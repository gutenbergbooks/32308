<span class="caption"><i>JAVANESE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT.</i></span>
<p>The origin of the Oceanic dialects, and of those of India beyond the
Ganges, more especially the civilized idioms of the Indian
Archipelago, is referred to a language which was that of an unknown
people inhabiting the island of Java. From this primitive language the
modern Javanese is supposed to be immediately derived. Javanese
literature consists of poems, dramas, songs, and historical and
religious writings. The accompanying facsimile is from a
mythological-religious tract written upon a vegetable paper of
native manufacture, and ornamented with grotesque drawings.</p>

<p>The Alexandrine Manuscript of the Christian Scriptures is almost
complete in both Testaments, the Septuagint version of the Old and the
original Greek of the New. It consists of 773 sheets, 12&frac34; by 10&frac34;
inches, of very thin gray goatskin vellum, written on both sides in
two columns of faint but clear characters. It was made in the early
part of the fifth century, under the supervision of Thecla, a noble
Christian lady of Alexandria, in the fifth century. It was brought
from Alexandria to Constantinople by Cyril Lucar, Patriarch of
Constantinople, who in 1624 gave it into the charge of the English
Ambassador for presentation to King James I.; but owing to James'
death before the presentation could be made, it was presented instead
to Charles I. It remained in the possession of the English sovereigns
until the Royal Library was presented to the nation by George II. in
1753. With the exception of the greater part of Matthew to Chapter
xxv., two leaves of John, and three of Second Corinthians, it contains
the whole Greek Bible, including the two Epistles of Clement of Rome,
which in early times ranked among the inspired books. Its table of
contents shows that it once included also the "Psalms of Solomon,"
though, from their position and title in the index, it is evident that
they were regarded as standing apart from the other books. The Museum
has bound the leaves of this precious manuscript in four volumes, and
has had photographic copies made of each page for the use of students.
The accompanying reproduction is from the last chapter of the First
Epistle of John, from "His Son," in verse 9, to the end.</p>

Diderot holds the place of leader. There were intellects of broader

was a marvel and an inspiration.</p>

</div>

<p>He was born in October 1713, in Langres, Haute-Marne, France; and died
in Paris July 31st, 1784. After a classical education in Jesuit
schools, he utterly disgusted his father by turning to the Bohemian
life of a litt&eacute;rateur in Paris. Although very poor, he married at the
age of thirty. The whole story of his married life&mdash;the common
Parisian story in those days&mdash;reflects no credit on him; though his
<i>liaison</i> with Mademoiselle Voland presents the aspects of a
friendship abiding through life. Poverty spurred him to exertion. Four
days of work in 1746 are said to have produced 'Pens&eacute;es
Philosophiques' (Philosophic Thoughts). This book, with a little essay
following it, 'Interpr&eacute;tation de la Nature,' was his first open attack
on revealed religion. Its argument, though only negative, and keeping
within the bounds of theism, foretokened a class of utterances which
were frequent in Diderot's later years, and whose assurance of his
materialistic atheism would be complete had they not been too
exclamatory for settled conviction. He contents himself with
glorifying the passions, to the annulling of all ethical standards. On
this point at least his convictions were stable, for long afterward he
writes thus to Mademoiselle Voland:&mdash;"The man of mediocre passion
lives and dies like the brute.... If we were bound to choose between
Racine, a bad husband, a bad father, a false friend, and a sublime
poet, and Racine, good father, good husband, good friend, and dull
worthy man, I hold to the first. Of Racine the bad man, what remains?
Nothing. Of Racine the man of genius? The work is eternal."</p>

<p>About 1747 he produced an allegory, 'Promenade du Sceptique.'
This French 'Pilgrim's Progress' scoffs at the Church of Rome for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4690" id="Page_4690">[Pg 4690]</a></span>
denying pleasure, then decries the pleasures of the world, and ends by
asserting the hopeless uncertainty of the philosophy which both scoffs
at the Church and decries worldly pleasure. At this period he was
evidently inclined to an irregular attack on the only forms of
Christianity familiar to him, asceticism and pietism.</p>

<p>In 1749 Diderot first showed himself a thinker of original power,
in his Letter on the Blind. This work, 'Lettre sur les Avengles
&agrave; l'Usage de Ceux qui Voient' (Letter on the Blind for the Use of
Those who See) opened the eyes of the public to Diderot's peculiar
genius, and the eyes of the authorities to the menace in his principles.
The result was his imprisonment, and from that the spread of
his views. His offense was, that through his ingenious supposition of
the mind deprived of its use of one or more of the bodily senses,
he had shown the relativity of all man's conceptions, and had thence
deduced the relativity, the lack of absoluteness, of all man's ethical
standards&mdash;thus invalidating the foundations of civil and social order.
The broad assertion that Diderot and his philosophic group caused
the French Revolution has only this basis, that these men were
among the omens of its advance, feeling its stir afar but not recognizing
the coming earthquake. Yet it may be conceded that Diderot
anticipated things great and strange; for his mind, although neither
precise nor capable of sustained and systematic thought, was amazingly
original in conception and powerful in grasp. The mist, blank
to his brethren, seems to have wreathed itself into wonderful shapes
to his eye; he was the seer whose wild enthusiasm caught the oracles
from an inner shrine. A predictive power appears in his Letter on
the Blind, where he imagines the blind taught to read by touch; and
nineteenth-century hypotheses gleam dimly in his random guess at
variability in organisms, and at survival of those best adapted to
their environment.</p>

<p>Diderot's monumental work, 'L'Encyclop&eacute;die,' dates from the middle
of the century. It was his own vast enlargement of Ephraim
Chambers's Cyclop&aelig;dia of 1727, of which a bookseller had demanded
a revision in French. D'Alembert was secured as his colleague, and
in 1751 the first volume appeared. The list of contributors includes
most of the great contemporary names in French literature. From
these, Diderot and D'Alembert gathered the inner group known as
the French Encyclop&aelig;dists, to whose writings has been ascribed a
general tendency to destroy religion and to reconstitute society.
The authorities interfered repeatedly, with threats and prohibitions
of the publication; but the science of government included the science
of connivance for an adequate consideration, and the great
work went forward. Its danger lurked in its principles; for Diderot
dealt but little in the cheap flattery which the modern demagogue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4691" id="Page_4691">[Pg 4691]</a></span>
addresses to the populace. D'Alembert, wearied by ten years of persecution,
retired in 1759, leaving the indefatigable Diderot to struggle
alone through seven years, composing and revising hundreds of
articles, correcting proofs, supervising the unrivaled illustrations of
the mechanic arts, while quieting the opposition of the authorities.</p>

<p>The Encyclop&aelig;dia under Diderot followed no one philosophic path.
Indeed, there are no signs that he ever gave any consideration to
either the intellectual or the ethical force of consistency. His
writing indicates his utter carelessness both as to the direction and
as to the pace of his thought. He had an abiding conviction that
Christianity was partly delusion and largely priestcraft, and was
maintained chiefly for upholding iniquitous privilege. His antagonism
was developed primarily from his emotions and sympathies rather than
from his intellect; hence it sometimes swerved, drawing perilously
near to formal orthodoxy. Moreover, this vivacious philosopher
sometimes rambled into practical advice, and easily effervesced into
fervid moralizings of the sentimental and almost tearful sort.
His immense natural capacity for sentiment appears in his own
account of his meeting with Grimm after a few months' absence. His
sentimentalism, however, had its remarkable counterpoise in a most
practical tendency of mind. In the Encyclop&aelig;dia the interests of
agriculture and of all branches of manufacture were treated with great
fullness; and the reform of feudal abuses lingering in the laws of
France was vigorously urged in a style more practical than cyclop&aelig;dic.</p>

<p>Diderot gave much attention to the drama, and his 'Paradoxe sur
le Com&eacute;dien' (Paradox on the Actor) is a valuable discussion. He is
the father of the modern domestic drama. His influence upon the
dramatic literature of Germany was direct and immediate; it appeared
in the plays of Lessing and Schiller, and much of Lessing's criticism
was inspired by Diderot. His 'P&egrave;re de Famille' (Family-Father) and
'Le Fils Naturel' (The Natural Son) marked the beginning of a new
era in the history of the stage, in the midst of which we are now
living. Breaking with the old traditions, Diderot abandoned the lofty
themes of classic tragedy and portrayed the life of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>.
The influence of England, frequently manifest in the work of the
Encyclop&aelig;dists, is evident also here. Richardson was then the chief
force in fiction, and the sentimental element so characteristic in him
reappears in the dramas of Diderot.</p>

<p>Goethe was strongly attracted by the genius of Diderot, and
thought it worth his while not only to translate but to supply with
a long and luminous commentary the latter's 'Essay on Painting.'
It was by a singular trick of fortune, too, that one of Diderot's
most powerful works should first have appeared in German garb, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4692" id="Page_4692">[Pg 4692]</a></span>
not in the original French until after the author's death. A manuscript
copy of the book chanced to fall into the hands of Goethe,
who so greatly admired it that he at once translated, annotated,
and published it. This was the famous dialogue 'Le Neveu de
Rameau' (Rameau's Nephew), a work which only Diderot's peculiar
genius could have produced. Depicting the typical parasite, shameless,
quick-witted for every species of villainy, at home in every possible
meanness, the dialogue is a probably unequaled compound of
satire, high &aelig;sthetics, gleaming humor, sentimental moralizing, fine
musical criticism, and scientific character analysis, with passages of
brutal indecency.</p>

<p>Among literary critics of painting, Diderot has his place in the
highest rank. His nine 'Salons'&mdash;criticisms which in his good-nature
he wrote for the use of his friend Grimm, on the annual exhibitions
in the Paris Salon from 1759 onward&mdash;have never been surpassed
among non-technical criticisms for brilliancy, freshness, and philosophic
suggestiveness. They reveal the man's elemental strength;
which was not in his knowledge, for he was without technical training
in art and had seen scarcely any of the world's masterpieces,
but in his sensuously sympathetic nature, which gave him quickness
of insight and delicacy in interpretation.</p>

<p>He had the faculty of making and keeping friends, being unaffected,
genial, amiable, enthusiastically generous and helpful to his
friends, and without vindictiveness to his foes. He needed these
qualities to counteract his almost utter lack of conscientiousness, his
gush of sentiment, his unregulated morals, his undisciplined genius,
his unbalanced thought. His style of writing, often vivid and strong,
is as often awkward and dull, and is frequently lacking in finish.
As a philosophic author and thinker his voluminous work is of little
enduring worth, for though plentiful in original power it totally lacks
organic unity; his thought rambles carelessly, his method is confused.
It has been said of him that he was a master who produced
no masterpiece. But as a talker, a converser, all witnesses testify
that he was wondrously inspiring and suggestive, speaking sometimes
as from mysterious heights of vision or out of unsearchable deeps of
thought.</p>

<h3><a name="RAMEAU" id="RAMEAU"></a>FROM 'RAMEAU'S NEPHEW'</h3>

<p>Be the weather fair or foul, it is my custom in any case at
five o'clock in the afternoon to stroll in the Palais Royal.
I am always to be seen alone and meditative, on the bench
D'Argenson. I hold converse with myself on politics or love, on
taste or philosophy, and yield up my soul entirely to its own
frivolity. It may follow the first idea that presents itself, be the
idea wise or foolish. In the All&eacute;e de Foi one sees our young
rakes following upon the heels of some courtesan who passes on
with shameless mien, laughing face, animated glance, and a pug
nose; but they soon leave her to follow another, teasing them
all, joining none of them. My thoughts are my courtesans.</p>

<p>When it is really too cold or rainy, I take refuge in the Caf&eacute;
de la R&eacute;gence and amuse myself by watching the chess-players.
Paris is the place of the world and the Caf&eacute; de la R&eacute;gence the
place of Paris where the best chess is played. There one witnesses
the most carefully calculated moves; there one hears the
most vulgar conversation; for since it is possible to be at once
a man of intellect and a great chess-player, like L&eacute;gal, so also
one may be at once a great chess-player and a very silly person,
like Foubert or Mayot.</p>

<p>One afternoon I was there, observing much, speaking rarely, and
hearing as little as possible, when one of the most singular
personages came up to me that ever was produced by this land of ours,
where surely God has never caused a dearth of singular characters.
He is a combination of high-mindedness and baseness, of sound
understanding and folly; in his head the conceptions of honor and
dishonor must be strangely tangled, for the good qualities with which
nature has endowed him he displays without boastfulness, and the bad
qualities without shame. For the rest, he is firmly built, has an
extraordinary power of imagination, and possesses an uncommonly strong
pair of lungs. Should you ever meet him and succeed in escaping from
the charm of his originality, it must be by stopping both ears with
your fingers or by precipitate flight. Heavens, what terrible lungs!</p>

<p>And nothing is less like him than he himself. Sometimes he
is thin and wasted, like a man in the last stages of consumption;
you could count his teeth through his cheeks; you would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4694" id="Page_4694">[Pg 4694]</a></span>
think he had not tasted food for several days, or had come from
La Trappe.</p>

<p>A month later he is fattened and filled out as if he had never
left the banquets of the rich or had been fed among the Bernardines.
To-day, with soiled linen, torn trousers, clad in rags,
and almost barefoot, he passes with bowed head, avoids those
whom he meets, till one is tempted to call him and bestow upon
him an alms. To-morrow, powdered, well groomed, well dressed,
and well shod, he carries his head high, lets himself be seen, and
you would take him almost for a respectable man.</p>

<p>So he lives from day to day, sad or merry, according to the
circumstances. His first care, when he rises in the morning, is
to take thought where he is to dine. After dinner he bethinks
himself of some opportunity to procure supper, and with the night
come new cares. Sometimes he goes on foot to his little attic,
which is his home if the landlady, impatient at long arrears of
rent, has not taken the key away from him. Sometimes he goes
to one of the taverns in the suburbs, and there, between a bit of
bread and a mug of beer, awaits the day. If he lacks the six
sous necessary to procure him quarters for the night, which is
occasionally the case, he applies to some cabman among his
friends or to the coachman of some great lord, and a place on the
straw beside the horses is vouchsafed him. In the morning he
carries a part of his mattress in his hair. If the season is mild,
he spends the whole night strolling back and forth on the Cours
or in the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es. With the day he appears again in
the city, dressed yesterday for to-day and to-day often for the
rest of the week.</p>

<p>For such originals I cannot feel much esteem, but there are
others who make close acquaintances and even friends of them.
Once in the year perhaps they are able to put their spell upon
me, when I meet them, because their character is in such strong
contrast to that of every-day humanity, and they break the oppressive
monotony which our education, our social conventions, our
traditional proprieties have produced. When such a man enters
a company, he acts like a cake of yeast that raises the whole, and
restores to each a part of his natural individuality. He shakes
them up, brings things into motion, elicits praise or censure,
drives truth into the open, makes upright men recognizable, unmasks
the rogues, and there the wise man sits and listens and is
enabled to distinguish one class from another.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4695" id="Page_4695">[Pg 4695]</a></span>
This particular specimen I had long known; he frequented a
house into which his talents had secured him the entr&eacute;e. These
people had an only daughter. He swore to the parents that he
would marry their daughter. They only shrugged their shoulders,
laughed in his face, and assured him that he was a fool.
But I saw the day come when the thing was accomplished. He
asked me for some money, which I gave him. He had, I know
not how, squirmed his way into a few houses, where a <i>couvert</i>
stood always ready for him, but it had been stipulated that he
should never speak without the consent of his hosts. So there he
sat and ate, filled the while with malice; it was fun to see him
under this restraint. The moment he ventured to break the
treaty and open his mouth, at the very first word the guests all
shouted "O Rameau!" Then his eyes flashed wrathfully, and he
fell upon his food again with renewed energy.</p>

<p>You were curious to know the man's name; there it is. He
is the nephew of the famous composer who has saved us from
the church music of Lulli which we have been chanting for a
hundred years, ... and who, having buried the Florentine,
will himself be buried by Italian virtuosi; he dimly feels this, and
so has become morose and irritable, for no one can be in a worse
humor&mdash;not even a beautiful woman who in the morning finds
a pimple on her nose&mdash;than an author who sees himself threatened
with the fate of outliving his reputation, as Marivaux and
Cr&eacute;billon <i>fils</i> prove.</p>

<p>Rameau's nephew came up to me. "Ah, my philosopher, do
I meet you once again? What are you doing here among the
good-for-nothings? Are you wasting your time pushing bits of
wood about?"</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;No; but when I have nothing better to do, I take a
passing pleasure in watching those who push them about with
skill.</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;A rare pleasure, surely. Excepting L&eacute;gal and Philidor,
there is no one here that understands it....</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;You are hard to please. I see that only the best finds
favor with you.</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Yes, in chess, checkers, poetry, oratory, music, and such
other trumpery. Of what possible use is mediocrity in these
things?</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;I am almost ready to agree with you....</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4696" id="Page_4696">[Pg 4696]</a></span>
<i>He</i>&mdash;You have always shown some interest in me, because
I'm a poor devil whom you really despise, but who after all
amuses you.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;That is true.</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Then let me tell you. (Before beginning, he drew a
deep sigh, covered his forehead with both hands, then with calm
countenance continued:&mdash;) You know I am ignorant, foolish,
silly, shameless, rascally, gluttonous.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;What a panegyric!</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;It is entirely true. Not a word to be abated; no contradiction,
I pray you. No one knows me better than I know myself, and I don't
tell all.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;Rather than anger you, I will assent.</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Now, just think, I lived with people who valued me precisely
because all these qualities were mine in a high degree.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;That is most remarkable. I have hitherto believed that
people concealed these qualities even from themselves, or excused
them, but always despised them in others.</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Conceal them? Is that possible? You may be sure that
when Palissot is alone and contemplates himself, he tells quite a
different story. You may be sure that he and his companion
make open confession to each other that they are a pair of arrant
rogues. Despise these qualities in others? My people were much
more reasonable, and I fared excellently well among them.
I was cock of the walk. When absent, I was instantly missed. I
was pampered. I was their little Rameau, their good Rameau,
the shameless, ignorant, lazy Rameau, the fool, the clown, the
gourmand. Each of these epithets was to me a smile, a caress, a
slap on the back, a box on the ears, a kick, a dainty morsel
thrown upon my plate at dinner, a liberty permitted me after
dinner as if it were of no account; for I am of no account.
People make of me and do before me and with me whatever
they please, and I never give it a thought....</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;You have been giving lessons, I understand, in accompaniment
and composition?</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;And you knew absolutely nothing about it?</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;No, by Heaven; and for that very reason I was a much
better teacher than those who imagine they know something
about it. At all events, I didn't spoil the taste nor ruin the hands
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4697" id="Page_4697">[Pg 4697]</a></span>
of my young pupils. If when they left me they went to a competent
master, they had nothing to unlearn, for they had learned
nothing, and that was just so much time and money saved.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;But how did you do it?</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;The way they all do it. I came, threw myself into a chair:&mdash;"How
bad the weather is! How tired the pavement makes one!" Then some
scraps of town gossip:... "At the last Amateur Concert there was an
Italian woman who sang like an angel.... Poor Dum&ecirc;nil doesn't know
what to say or do," etc., etc. ... "Come, mademoiselle, where is your
music-book?" And as mademoiselle displays no great haste, searches
every nook and corner for the book, which she has mislaid, and finally
calls the maid to help her, I continue:&mdash;"Little Clairon is an enigma.
There is talk of a perfectly absurd marriage of&mdash;what is her
name?"&mdash;"Nonsense, Rameau, it isn't possible."&mdash;"They say the affair
is all settled." ... "There is a rumor that Voltaire is dead,"&mdash;"All
the better."&mdash;"Why all the better?"&mdash;"Then he is sure to treat us to
some droll skit. That's a way he has, a fortnight before his death."
What more should I say? I told a few scandals about the families in
the houses where I am received, for we are all great scandal-mongers.
In short, I played the fool; they listened and laughed, and exclaimed,
"He is really too droll, isn't he?" Meanwhile the music-book had been
found under a chair, where a little dog or a little cat had worried
it, chewed it, and torn it. Then the pretty child sat down at the
piano and began to make a frightful noise upon it. I went up to her,
secretly making a sign of approbation to her mother. "Well, now, that
isn't so bad," said the mother; "one needs only to make up one's mind
to a thing; but the trouble is, one will not make up one's mind; one
would rather kill time by chattering, trifling, running about, and God
knows what. Scarcely do you turn your back but the book is closed, and
not until you are at her side again is it opened. Besides, I have
never heard you reprimand her." In the mean time, since something had
to be done, I took her hands and placed them differently. I pretended
to lose my patience; I shouted,&mdash;"Sol, sol, sol, mademoiselle, it's a
<i>sol</i>." The mother: "Mademoiselle, have you no ears? I'm not at the
piano, I'm not looking at your notes, but my own feeling tells me that
it ought to be a <i>sol</i>. You give the gentleman infinite trouble.
You remember nothing, and make no progress." To break the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4698" id="Page_4698">[Pg 4698]</a></span>
force of this reproof a little, I tossed my head and said: "Pardon me, madame,
pardon me. It would be better if mademoiselle would only practice a
little, but after all it is not so bad."&mdash;"In your place I would keep
her a whole year at one piece."&mdash;"Rest assured, I shall not let her
off until she has mastered every difficulty; and that will not take so
long, perhaps, as mademoiselle thinks."&mdash;"Monsieur Rameau, you flatter
her; you are too good." And that is the only thing they would remember
of the whole lesson, and would upon occasion repeat to me. So the
lesson came to an end. My pupil handed me the fee, with a graceful
gesture and a courtesy which her dancing-master had taught her. I put
the money into my pocket, and the mother said, "That's very nice,
mademoiselle. If Favillier were here, he would praise you." For
appearance's sake I chattered for a minute or two more; then I
vanished; and that is what they called in those days a lesson in
accompaniment.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;And is the case different now?</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Heavens! I should think so. I come in, I am serious,
throw my muff aside, open the piano, try the keys, show signs
of great impatience, and if I am kept a moment waiting I shout
as if my purse had been stolen. In an hour I must be there or
there; in two hours with the Duchess So-and-so; at noon I must
go to the fair Marquise; and then there is to be a concert at
Baron de Bagge's, Rue Neuve des Petits Champs.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;And meanwhile no one expects you at all.</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Certainly not.... And precisely because I can further my fortune
through vices which come natural to me, which I acquired without labor
and practice without effort, which are in harmony with the customs of
my countrymen, which are quite to the taste of my patrons, and better
adapted to their special needs than inconvenient virtues would be,
which from morning to night would be standing accusations against
them, it would be strange indeed if I should torture myself like one
of the damned to twist and turn and make of myself something which I
am not, and hide myself beneath a character foreign to me, and assume
the most estimable qualities, whose worth I will not dispute, but
which I could acquire and live up to only by great exertions, and
which after all would lead to nothing,&mdash;perhaps to worse
than nothing. Moreover, ought a beggar like me, who lives upon
the wealthy, constantly to hold up to his patrons a mirror
of good conduct? People praise virtue but hate it; they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4699" id="Page_4699">[Pg 4699]</a></span>
fly from it, let it freeze; and in this world a man has to keep his
feet warm. Besides, I should always be in the sourest humor: for why
is it that the pious and the devotional are so hard, so repellent, so
unsociable? It is because they have imposed upon themselves a task
contrary to their nature. They suffer, and when a man suffers he makes
others suffer. Now, that is no affair of mine or of my patrons'. I
must be in good spirits, easy, affable, full of sallies, drollery, and
folly. Virtue demands reverence, and reverence is inconvenient; virtue
challenges admiration, and admiration is not entertaining. I have to
do with people whose time hangs heavy on their hands; they want to
laugh. Now consider the folly: the ludicrous makes people laugh, and I
therefore must be a fool; I must be amusing, and if nature had not
made me so, then by hook or by crook I should have made myself seem
so. Fortunately I have no need to play the hypocrite. There are
hypocrites enough of all colors without me, and not counting those who
deceive themselves.... Should it ever occur to friend Rameau to play
Cato, to despise fortune, women, good living, idleness, what would he
be? A hypocrite. Let Rameau remain what he is, a happy robber among
wealthy robbers, and a man without either real or boasted virtue. In
short, your idea of happiness, the happiness of a few enthusiastic
dreamers like you, has no charm for me....</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;He earns his bread dearly, who in order to live must
assail virtue and knowledge.</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;I have already told you that we are of no consequence.
We slander all men and grieve none.</p>

<p style='text-align:center;'>[The dialogue reverts to music.]</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;Every imitation has its original in nature. What is the
musician's model when he breaks into song?</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Why do you not grasp the subject higher up? What is
song?</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;That, I confess, is a question beyond my powers. That's
the way with us all. The memory is stored with words only,
which we think we understand because we often use them and
even apply them correctly, but in the mind we have only indefinite
conceptions. When I use the word "song," I have no more
definite idea of it than you and the majority of your kind have
when you say reputation, disgrace, honor, vice, virtue, shame,
propriety, mortification, ridicule.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4700" id="Page_4700">[Pg 4700]</a></span>
<i>He</i>&mdash;Song is an imitation in tones, produced either by the voice or
by instruments, of a scale invented by art, or if you will,
established by nature; an imitation of physical sounds or passionate
utterances; and you see, with proper alterations this definition could
be made to fit painting, oratory, sculpture, and poetry. Now to come
to your question, What is the model of the musician or of song? It is
the declamation, when the model is alive or sensate; it is the tone,
when the model is insensate. The declamation must be regarded as a
line, and the music as another line which twines about it. The
stronger and the more genuine is this declamation, this model of song,
the more numerous the points at which the accompanying music
intersects it, the more beautiful will it be. And this our younger
composers have clearly perceived. When one hears "Je suis un pauvre
diable," one feels that it is a miser's complaint. If he didn't sing,
he would address the earth in the very same tones when he intrusts to
its keeping his gold: "O terre, re&ccedil;ois mon tr&eacute;sor." ... In such works
with the greatest variety of characters, there is a convincing truth
of declamation that is unsurpassed. I tell you, go, go, and hear the
aria where the young man who feels that he is dying, cries out, "Mon
c&#339;ur s'en va." Listen to the air, listen to the accompaniment, and
then tell me what difference there is between the true tones of a
dying man and the handling of this music. You will see that the line
of the melody exactly coincides with the line of declamation. I say
nothing of the time, which is one of the conditions of song; I confine
myself to the expression, and there is nothing truer than the
statement which I have somewhere read, "Musices seminarium
accentus,"&mdash;the accent is the seed-plot of the melody. And for that
reason, consider how difficult and important a matter it is to be able
to write a good recitative. There is no beautiful aria out of which a
beautiful recitative could not be made; no beautiful recitative out of
which a clever man could not produce a beautiful aria. I will not
assert that one who recites well will also be able to sing well, but I
should be much surprised if a good singer could not recite well. And
you may believe all that I tell you now, for it is true.</p>

<p>(And then he walked up and down and began to hum a few arias
from the "&Icirc;le des Fons," etc., exclaiming from time to time,
with upturned eyes and hands upraised:&mdash;) "Isn't that beautiful,
great heavens! isn't that beautiful? Is it possible to have a pair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4701" id="Page_4701">[Pg 4701]</a></span>
of ears on one's head and question its beauty?" Then as his enthusiasm
rose he sang quite softly, then more loudly as he became more
impassioned, then with gestures, grimaces, contortions of body.
"Well," said I, "he is losing his mind, and I may expect a new scene."
And in fact, all at once he burst out singing.... He passed from one
aria to another, fully thirty of them,&mdash;Italian, French, tragic,
comic, of every sort. Now with a deep bass he descended into hell;
then, contracting his throat, he split the upper air with a falsetto,
and in gait, mien, and action he imitated the different singers, by
turns raving, commanding, mollified, scoffing. There was a little girl
that wept, and he hit off all her pretty little ways. Then he was a
priest, a king, a tyrant; he threatened, commanded, stormed; then he
was a slave and submissive. He despaired, he grew tender, he lamented,
he laughed, always in the tone, the time, the sense of the words, of
the character, of the situation.</p>

<p>All the chess-players had left their boards and were gathered
around him; the windows of the caf&eacute; were crowded with passers-by,
attracted by the noise. There was laughter enough to bring
down the ceiling. He noticed nothing, but went on in such a
rapt state of mind, in an enthusiasm so close to madness, that I
was uncertain whether he would recover, or if he would be
thrown into a cab and taken straight to the mad-house; the while
he sang the Lamentations of Jomelli.</p>

<p>With precision, fidelity, and incredible warmth, he rendered one of
the finest passages, the superb obligato recitative in which the
prophet paints the destruction of Jerusalem; he wept himself, and the
eyes of the listeners were moist. More could not be desired in
delicacy of vocalization, nor in the expression of overwhelming grief.
He dwelt especially on those parts in which the great composer has
shown his greatness most clearly. When he was not singing, he took the
part of the instruments; these he quickly dropped again, to return to
the vocal part, weaving one into the other so perfectly that the
connection, the unity of the whole, was preserved. He took possession
of our souls and held them in the strangest suspense I have ever
experienced. Did I admire him? Yes, I admired him. Was I moved and
melted? I was moved and melted, and yet something of the ludicrous
mingled itself with these feelings and modified their nature.</p>

<p>But you would have burst out laughing at the way he imitated
the different instruments. With a rough muffled tone and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4702" id="Page_4702">[Pg 4702]</a></span>
puffed-out cheeks he represented horns and bassoon; for the oboe he assumed a
rasping nasal tone; with incredible rapidity he made his voice run
over the string instruments, whose tones he endeavored to reproduce
with the greatest accuracy; the flute passages he whistled; he rumbled
out the sounds of the German flute; he shouted and sang with the
gestures of a madman, and so alone and unaided he impersonated the
entire ballet corps, the singers, the whole orchestra,&mdash;in short, a
complete performance,&mdash;dividing himself into twenty different
characters, running, stopping, with the mien of one entranced, with
glittering eyes and foaming mouth.... He was quite beside himself.
Exhausted by his exertions, like a man awakening from a deep sleep or
emerging from a long period of abstraction, he remained motionless,
stupefied, astonished. He looked about him in bewilderment, like one
trying to recognize the place in which he finds himself. He awaited
the return of his strength, of his consciousness; he dried his face
mechanically. Like one who upon awaking finds his bed surrounded by
groups of people, in complete oblivion and profound unconsciousness of
what he had been doing, he cried, "Well, gentlemen, what's the matter?
What are you laughing at? What are you wondering about? What's the
matter?"</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;My dear Rameau, let us talk again of music. Tell me
how it comes that with the facility you display for appreciating
the finest passages of the great masters, for retaining them in
your memory, and for rendering them to the delight of others
with all the enthusiasm with which the music inspires you,&mdash;how
comes it that you have produced nothing of value yourself?</p>

<p>(Instead of answering me, he tossed his head, and raising his
finger towards heaven, cried:&mdash;)</p>

<p>The stars, the stars! When nature made Leo, Vinci, Pergolese, Duni,
she wore a smile; her face was solemn and commanding when she created
my dear uncle Rameau, who for ten years has been called the great
Rameau, and who will soon be named no more. But when she scraped his
nephew together, she made a face and a face and a face.&mdash;(And as he
spoke he made grimaces, one of contempt, one of irony, one of scorn.
He went through the motions of kneading dough, and smiled at the
ludicrous forms he gave it. Then he threw the strange pagoda from
him.) So she made me and threw me down among other pagodas,
some with portly well-filled paunches, short necks,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4703" id="Page_4703">[Pg 4703]</a></span>
protruding goggle eyes, and an apoplectic appearance; others with lank
and crooked necks and emaciated forms, with animated eyes and hawks'
noses. These all felt like laughing themselves to death when they saw
me, and when I saw them I set my arms akimbo and felt like laughing
myself to death, for fools and clowns take pleasure in one another;
seek one another out, attract one another. Had I not found upon my
arrival in this world the proverb ready-made, that the money of fools
is the inheritance of the clever, the world would have owed it to me.
I felt that nature had put my inheritance into the purse of the
pagodas, and I tried in a thousand ways to recover it.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;I know these ways. You have told me of them. I have
admired them. But with so many capabilities, why do you not
try to accomplish something great?</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;That is exactly what a man of the world said to the Abb&eacute; Le
Blanc. The abb&eacute; replied:&mdash;"The Marquise de Pompadour takes me in hand
and brings me to the door of the Academy; then she withdraws her hand;
I fall and break both legs."&mdash;"You ought to pull yourself together,"
rejoined the man of the world, "and break the door in with your
head."&mdash;"I have just tried that," answered the abb&eacute;, "and do you know
what I got for it? A bump on the head." ... (Then he drank a swallow
from what remained in the bottle and turned to his neighbor.) Sir, I
beg you for a pinch of snuff. That's a fine snuff-box you have there.
You are a musician? No! All the better for you. They are a lot of poor
deplorable wretches. Fate made me one of them, me! Meanwhile at
Montmartre there is a mill, and in the mill there is perhaps a miller
or a miller's lad, who will never hear anything but the roaring of the
mill, and who might have composed the most beautiful of songs. Rameau,
get you to the mill, to the mill; it's there you belong . . . But it
is half-past five. I hear the vesper bell which summons me too.
Farewell. It's true, is it not, philosopher, I am always the same
Rameau?</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;Yes, indeed. Unfortunately.</p>

<p><i>He</i>&mdash;Let me enjoy my misfortune forty years longer. He
laughs best who laughs last.</p>

<h2><a name="FRANZ_VON_DINGELSTEDT" id="FRANZ_VON_DINGELSTEDT"></a>FRANZ VON DINGELSTEDT</h2>

<h4>(1814-1881)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/capf34.png" width="90" height="90" alt="F" title="F" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ranz von Dingelstedt was born at Halsdorf, Hessen, Germany, June
30th, 1814. He attained eminence as a poet and dramatist, but his best
powers were devoted to his principal calling as theatre director.</p>

<p>His boyhood's education was received at Rinteln. At the University of
Marburg he applied himself to theology and philology, but more
especially to modern languages and literature. After leaving the
university he became instructor at Ricklingen, near Hanover. He was
characterized, even as a young man, by his political freedom and
independence of thought; and at Cassel, where in 1836 he was teacher
in the Lyceum, he was on this account looked upon so much askance that
it was found expedient to transfer him to the gymnasium at Fulda
(1838). He resigned this position, however, in order to devote himself
to writing. A collection of his poems appeared in 1838-45, and of
these, 'Lieder eines Kosmopolitischen Nachtw&auml;chters' (Songs of a
Cosmopolitan Night-Watchman: 1841) may be said to have produced a
genuine agitation. These were not only important as literature, but as
political promulgations, boldly embodying the radical sentiments of
freethinking Germany.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 178px;">

</div>

<p>In 1841 he went to Augsburg, connected himself with the Allgemeine
Zeitung, and traveled as newspaper correspondent in France,
Holland, Belgium, and England. 'Das Wanderbuch' (The Wander-Book),
and 'Jusqu' &agrave; la Mer&mdash;Erinnerungen aus Holland' (As Far as
the Sea&mdash;Remembrances of Holland: 1847), were the fruits of these
journeys. He had in contemplation a voyage to the Orient, and preparatory
to this he settled for a short time in Vienna; but the journey
was not undertaken, for just at this time he was appointed
librarian of the Royal Library of Stuttgart, and reader to the king,
with the title of Court Councilor. Here in 1844 he married the celebrated
singer Jenny Lutzer. He returned to Vienna, where in 1850
his drama 'Das Haus der Barneveldt' (The House of the Barneveldts)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4705" id="Page_4705">[Pg 4705]</a></span>
was produced with such brilliant success that he was thereupon
appointed stage manager of the National Theatre at Munich. To
this for six years he devoted his best efforts, presenting in the
most admirable manner the finest of the German classics. The merit
of his work was recognized by the king, who ennobled him in 1857.
He was pre-eminently a theatrical manager, and served successively
at Weimar (1857) and at Vienna, where he was appointed director of
the Court Opera House in 1867, and of the Burg Theatre in 1870.
He brought the classic plays of other lands upon the stage, and
his revivals of Shakespeare's historical plays and the 'Winter's Tale,'
and of Moli&egrave;re's 'L'Avare' (The Miser), were brilliant events in the
theatrical annals of Vienna. He was made Imperial Councilor by the
Emperor, and raised in 1876 to the rank of baron. In 1875 he took
the position of general director of both court theatres of Vienna. He
died at Vienna, May 15th, 1881.</p>

<p>The novels 'Licht und Schatten der Liebe' (The Light and
Shadow of Love: 1838); 'Heptameron,' 1841; and 'Novellenbuch,'
1855, were not wholly successful; but in contrast to these, 'Unter
der Erde' (Under the Earth: 1840); 'Sieben Friedliche Erz&auml;hlungen'
(Seven Peaceful Tales: 1844), and 'Die Amazone' (The Amazon:
1868), are admirable.</p>

<p>Regarded purely as literature, Dingelstedt's best productions are
his early poems, although his commentaries upon Shakespeare and
Goethe are wholly praiseworthy. He was successful chiefly as a
political poet, but his muse sings also the joys of domestic life.
'Hauslieder' (Household Songs: 1844), and his poems upon Chamisso
and Uhland, are among the most beautiful personal poems in German
literature.</p>

<h3><a name="BUSSMAN" id="BUSSMAN"></a>A MAN OF BUSINESS</h3>
<h4>From 'The Amazon': copyrighted by G.P. Putnam's Sons</h4>

<p>Herr Krafft was about to reply, but was prevented by the hasty
appearance of Herr Heyboldt, the first procurist, who entered the
apartment; not an antiquated comedy figure in shoe-buckles, coarse
woolen socks, velvet pantaloons, and a long-tailed coat, his vest full
of tobacco, and a goose-quill back of his comically flexible ear; no,
but a fine-looking man, dressed in the latest style and in black, with
a medal in his button-hole, and having an earnest, expressive countenance.
He was house-holder, member of the City Council, and militia captain;
the gold medal and colored ribbon on his left breast told of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4706" id="Page_4706">[Pg 4706]</a></span>
having saved, at the risk of his own life, a Leander who
had been carried away by the current in the swimming-baths.</p>

<p>His announcement, urgent as it was, was made without haste, deliberate
and cool, somewhat as the mate informs the captain that an ugly wind
has sprung up. "Herr Principal," he said, "the crowd has broken in the
barriers and one wing of the gateway; they are attacking the
counting-house." "Who breaks, pays," said Krafft, with a joke; "we
will charge the sport to their account."&mdash;"The police are not strong
enough; they have sent to the Royal Watch for military."&mdash;"That is
right, Heyboldt. No accident, no arms or legs broken?"&mdash;"Not that I
know of."&mdash;"Pity for Meyer Hirsch; he would have thundered
magnificently in the official Morning News against the excesses of the
rage for speculation. Nor any one wounded by the police?"&mdash;"Not any,
so far."&mdash;"Pity for Hirsch Meyer. The oppositional Evening Journal has
missed a capital opportunity of weeping over the barbarity of the
soldateska. At all events, the two papers must continue to write&mdash;one
for, the other against us. Keep Hirsch Meyer and Meyer Hirsch
going."&mdash;"All right, Herr Principal."&mdash;"Send each of them a polite
line, to the effect that we have taken the liberty of keeping a few
shares for him, to sell them at the most favorable moment, and pay him
over the difference."&mdash;"It shall be attended to, Herr Principal."&mdash;"So
our Southwestern Railway goes well, Heyboldt?"&mdash;"By steam, Herr
Principal." The sober man smiled at his daring joke, and Herr Krafft
smiled affably with him. "The amount that we have left to furnish will
be exhausted before one has time to turn around. The people throw
money, bank-notes, government bonds, at our cashiers, who cannot fill
up the receipts fast enough. On the Bourse they fought for the
blanks."&mdash;"For the next four weeks we will run the stock up, Heyboldt;
after that it can fall, but slowly, with decorum."&mdash;"I understand,
Herr Principal."</p>

<p>A cashier came rushing in without knocking. "Herr Principal," he
stammered in his panic, "we have not another blank, and the people are
pouring in upon us more and more violently. Wild shouts call for you."
"To your place, sir," thundered Krafft at him. "I shall come when I
think it time. In no case," he added more quietly, "before the
military arrive. We need an interference, for the sake of the market."
The messenger disappeared; but pale, bewildered countenances were to
be seen in the doorways of the comptoir; the house called for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4707" id="Page_4707">[Pg 4707]</a></span>
its master: the trembling daughter sent again and again for her father.</p>

<p>"Let us bring the play to a close," said Herr Krafft, after brief
deliberation; he stepped into the middle office, flung open a window,
and raising his harsh voice to its loudest tones, cried to the throng
below, "You are looking for me, folks. Here I am. What do you want of
me?" "Shares, subscriptions," was the noisy answer.&mdash;"You claim
without any right or any manners. This is my house, a peaceable
citizen's house. You are breaking in as though it were a dungeon, an
arsenal, a tax-office,&mdash;as though we were in the midst of a
revolution. Are you not ashamed of yourselves?" A confused murmur rang
through the astonished ranks. "If you wish to do business with me,"
continued the merchant, "you must first learn manners and discipline.
Have I invited your visit? Do I need your money, or do you need my
shares? Send up some deputies to convey your requests. I shall have
nothing to do with a turbulent mob." So saying, he closed the window
with such violence that the panes cracked, and the fragments fell down
on the heads of the assailants.</p>

<p>"The Principal knows how to talk to the people," said Heyboldt with
pride to Roland, the mute witness of this strange scene. "He speaks
their own language. He replies to a broken door with a broken window."</p>

<p>Meantime a company of soldiers had arrived on double-quick, with a
flourish of drums. The officer's word of command rang through the
crowd, now grown suddenly quiet: "Fix bayonets! form line! march!"
Yard and passages were cleared, the doors guarded; in the street the
low muttering tide, forced back, made a sort of dam. Three deputies,
abashed and confused, appeared at Krafft's door and craved audience.
The merchant received them like a prince surrounded by his court, in
the midst of his clerks, in the large counting-room. The spokesman
commenced: "We ask your pardon, Herr Krafft, for what has
happened."&mdash;"For shame, that you should drag in soldiers
as witnesses and peacemakers in a quiet little business affair
among order-loving citizens."&mdash;"It was reported that we
had been fooled with these subscriptions, and that the entire sum had
been already disposed of on the Bourse."&mdash;"And even if that were so,
am I to be blamed for it? The Southwestern Railway must raise thirty
millions. Double, treble that amount is offered it. Can I prevent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4708" id="Page_4708">[Pg 4708]</a></span>
the necessity of reducing the subscriptions?"&mdash;"No; but they say
that we poor folks shall not get a cent's worth; the big men of the
Bourse have gobbled up the best bits right before our
noses."&mdash;"They say so? Who says so? Court Cooper T&auml;ubert, I
ask you who says so?"&mdash;"Gracious Herr Court Banker&mdash;" "Don't
Court or Gracious me. My name is Krafft, Herr Hans Heinrich Krafft. I
think we know each other, Master T&auml;ubert. It is not the first
time that we have done business together. You have a very snug little
share in my workingmen's bank. Grain-broker W&uuml;st, you have bought
one of the houses in my street. Do I ever dun you for the installments
of purchase money?" "No indeed, Herr Krafft; you are a good man, a
public-spirited man, no money-maker, no leech, no Jew!" cried the
triumvirate of deputies in chorus.&mdash;"I am nothing more than you
are: a man of business, who works for his living, the son of a
peasant, a plain simple citizen. I began in a smaller way than any of
you; but I shall never forget that I am flesh of your flesh, blood of
your blood. Facts have proved it. I will give you a fresh proof
to-day. Go home and tell the people who have sent you, Hans Heinrich
Krafft will give up the share which his house has subscribed to the
Southwestern Railway, in favor of the less wealthy citizens of this
city. This sum of five hundred thousand thalers shall be divided up
<i>pro rata</i> among the subscriptions under five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you, Herr Krafft!" stammered out the court cooper, and
the grain-broker essayed to shed a tear of gratitude; the confidential
clerk Herr Lange, the third of the group, caught at the hand of the
patron to kiss it, with emotion. Krafft drew it back angrily. "No
self-abasement, Herr Lange," he said. "We are men of the people; let
us behave as such. God bless you, gentlemen. You know my purpose. Make
it known to the good people waiting outside, and see that I am rid of
my billeting. Let the subscriptions be conducted quietly and in good
order. Adieu, children!" The deputation withdrew. A few minutes
afterwards there was heard a thundering hurrah:&mdash;"Hurrah for Herr
Krafft! Three cheers for Father Krafft!" He showed himself at the
window, nodded quickly and soberly, and motioned to them to disperse.</p>

<p>While the tumult was subsiding, Krafft and Roland retired into the
private counting-room. "You have," the latter said, "spoken nobly,
acted nobly."&mdash;"I have made a bargain, nothing more,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4709" id="Page_4709">[Pg 4709]</a></span>
nothing less; moreover, not a bad one."&mdash;"How so?"&mdash;"In three months
I shall buy at 70, perhaps still lower, what I am now to give up to them at
90."&mdash;"You know that beforehand?"&mdash;"With mathematical certainty. The
public expects an El Dorado in the Southwestern Railway, as it does in
every new enterprise. The undertaking is a good one, it is true, or I
should not have ventured upon it. But one must be able to wait until
the fruit is ripe. The small holders cannot do that; they sow today,
and tomorrow they wish to reap. At the first payment their heart and
their purse are all right. At the second or third, both are gone. Upon
the least rise they will throw the paper, for which they were ready to
break each other's necks, upon the market, and so depreciate their
property. But if some fortuitous circumstance should cause a pressure
upon the money market, then they drop all that they have, in a perfect
panic, for any price. I shall watch this moment, and buy. In a year or
so, when the road is finished and its communications complete, the
shares that were subscribed for at 90, and which I shall have bought
at 60 to 70, will touch 100, or higher."</p>

<p>"That is to say," said Roland, thoughtfully, "you will gain at the
expense of those people whose confidence you have aroused, then
satisfied with objects of artificial value, and finally drained for
yourself." "Business is business," replied the familiar harsh voice.
"Unless I become a counterfeiter or a forger I can do nothing more
than to convert other persons' money into my own; of course, in an
honest way."&mdash;"And you do this, without fearing lest one day some one
mightier and luckier than you should do the same to you?"&mdash;"I must be
prepared for that; I am prepared."&mdash;"Also for the storm,&mdash;not one of
your own creating, but one sent by the wrath of God, that shall
scatter all this paper splendor of our times, and reduce this
appalling social inequality of ours to a universal zero?" "Let us
quietly abide this Last Day," laughed the banker, taking the artist
by the arm.</p>

<h2><a name="DIOGENES_LAERTIUS" id="DIOGENES_LAERTIUS"></a>DIOGENES LAERTIUS</h2>

<h4>(200-250 A. D.?)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 92px;">
<img src="images/capi41.png" width="92" height="89" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">t is curious how often we are dependent, for our knowledge of
some larger subject, upon a single ancient author, who would be hardly
worthy of notice but for the accidental loss of the books composed by
fitter and abler men. Thus, our only general description of Greece at
the close of the classical period is written by a man who describes
many objects that he certainly did not see, who leaves unmentioned
numberless things we wish explained, and who has a genius for so
misplacing an adverb as to bring confusion into the most commonplace
statement. But not even to Pausanias do we proffer such grudging
gratitude and such ungrateful objurgations as to Diogenes Laertius,
our chief&mdash;often our sole&mdash;authority for the 'Lives and Sayings of the
Philosophers.' His book is a fascinating one, and even amusing, if we
can forget what we so much wanted in its stead. At second or third
hand, from the compendiums of the schools rather than from the
original works of the great masters themselves, Diogenes does give us
a fairly intelligible sketch, as a rule, of the outward life lived by
each sage. This slight frame is crammed with anecdotes, evidently
culled with most eager and uncritical hand from miscellaneous
collections. Many of these stories are so fragmentary as to be
pointless. Others are unquestionably attached to the wrong person.
This method is at its maddest in the author's sketch of his namesake,
the Recluse of the Tub. (One of Ali Baba's <i>jars</i>, by the way, would
give a better notion of the real hermitage.) Since this "philosopher"
had himself little character and no doctrines, the loose string of
anecdotes, puns, and saucy answers suits all our needs. Throughout the
work are scattered, apocryphal letters, and feeble poetic epigrams
composed by the compiler himself. The leaning of our most
unphilosophic author was apparently toward Epicurus. The loss of that
teacher's own works causes us to prize doubly the extensive fragments
of them preserved in this relatively copious and serious study. The
lover of the great Epicurean poem of Lucretius on the 'Nature of Things'
will often be surprised to find here the source of many among the Roman
poet's most striking doctrines and images. The sketch of Zeno is also an
important authority on Stoicism. Instruction in these particular chapters,
then, and rich diversion elsewhere, await the reader of this most gossipy,
formless, and uncritical volume. The English reader, by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4712" id="Page_4712">[Pg 4712]</a></span>
way, ought to be provided with something better than the "Bohn"
version. This adds a goodly harvest of ludicrous misprints and other
errors of every kind to Diogenes's own mixture of borrowed wisdom and
native silliness. The classical student will prefer the <i>Didot</i>
edition by Cobet, with the Latin version in parallel columns.</p>

<p>It has been thought desirable to offer here a version, slightly
abridged, of Diogenes's chapter on Socrates. The original sources, in
Plato's and Xenophon's extant works, will almost always explain, or
correct, the statements of Diogenes. Such wild shots as the assertion
that the plague repeatedly visited Athens, striking down <i>every
inhabitant</i> save the temperate Socrates, hardly need a serious
rejoinder. Diogenes cannot even speak with approximate accuracy of
Socrates's famous D&aelig;mon or Inward Monitor. We know, on the best
authority, that it prophesied nothing, even proposed nothing, but only
vetoed the rasher impulses of its human companion. But to apply the
tests of mere accuracy to Diogenes would be like criticizing Uncle
Remus for his sins against English syntax.</p>

<p>Of the author's life we know nothing. Our assignment of him to the
third century is based merely on the fact that he quotes writers of
the second, and is himself in turn cited by somewhat later authors.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="SOCRATES" id="SOCRATES"></a>LIFE OF SOCRATES</h3>
<h4>From the 'Lives and Sayings of the Philosophers'</h4>

<p>Socrates was the son of Sophroniscus a sculptor and Ph&aelig;narete
a midwife [as Plato also states in the 'Theaetetus'], and
an Athenian, of the deme Alopeke. He was believed to aid
Euripides in composing his dramas.  Hence Mnesimachus speaks
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is Euripides's new play, the 'Phrygians':<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Socrates has furnished him the sticks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Euripides, Socratically patched."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Callias also, in his 'Captives,' says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>A</i>&mdash;"Why art so solemn, putting on such airs?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>B</i>&mdash;Indeed I may; the cause is Socrates."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Aristophanes, in the 'Clouds,' again, remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And this is he who for Euripides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Composed the talkative wise tragedies."<br /></span></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4713" id="Page_4713">[Pg 4713]</a></span>
He was a pupil of Anaxagoras, according to some authorities, but
also of Damon, as Alexander states in his 'Successions.' After
the former's condemnation he became a disciple of Archelaus the
natural philosopher. But Douris says he was a slave, and carried
stones. Some say, too, that the Graces on the Acropolis are his;
they are clothed figures. Hence, they say, Timon in his 'Silli'
declares:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From them proceeded the stone-polisher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prater on law, enchanter of the Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who taught the art of subtle argument,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nose-in-air, mocker of orators,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half Attic, the adept in irony."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For he was also clever in discussion. But the Thirty Tyrants,
as Xenophon tells us, forbade him to teach the art of arguing.
Aristophanes also brings him on in comedy, making the Worse
Argument seem the better. He was moreover the first, with his
pupil &AElig;schines, to teach oratory. He was likewise the first who
conversed about life, and the first of the philosophers who came
to his end by being condemned to death. We are also told that
he lent out money. At least, investing it, he would collect what
was due, and then after spending it invest again. But Demetrius
the Byzantine says it was Crito who, struck by the charm of his
character, took him out of the workshop and educated him.</p>

<p>Realizing that natural philosophy was of no interest to men,
it is said, he discussed ethics, in the workshops and in the
agora, and used to say he was seeking</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whatsoever is good in human dwellings, or evil."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And very often, we are told, when in these discussions he conversed
too violently, he was beaten or had his hair pulled out,
and was usually laughed to scorn. So once when he was kicked,
and bore it patiently, some one expressed surprise; but he said,
"If an ass had kicked me, would I bring an action against him?"</p>

<p>Foreign travel he did not require, as most men do, except when he had
to serve in the army. At other times, remaining in Athens, he disputed
in argumentative fashion with those who conversed with him, not so as
to deprive them of their belief, but to strive for the ascertainment
of truth. They say Euripides gave him the work of Heraclitus, and
asked him, "What do you think of it?" And he said, "What I understood
is fine; I suppose what I did not understand is, too; only it needs a Delian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4714" id="Page_4714">[Pg 4714]</a></span>
diver!" He attended also to physical training, and was in
excellent condition. Moreover, he went on the expedition to
Amphipolis, and when Xenophon had fallen from his horse in the battle
of Delium he picked him up and saved him. Indeed, when all the other
Athenians were fleeing he retreated slowly, turning about calmly, and
on the lookout to defend himself if attacked. He also joined the
expedition to Potid&aelig;a&mdash;by sea, for the war prevented a march by land;
and it was there he was said once to have remained standing in one
position all night. There too, it is said, he was pre-eminent in
valor, but gave up the prize to Alcibiades, of whom he is stated to
have been very fond. Ion of Chios says moreover that when young he
visited Samos with Archelaus, and Aristotle states that he went to
Delphi. Favorinus again, in the first book of his 'Commentaries' says
he went to the Isthmus.</p>

<p>He was also very firm in his convictions and devoted to the
democracy, as was evident from his not yielding to Critias and
his associates when they bade him bring Leon of Salamis, a
wealthy man, to them to be put to death. He was also the only
one who opposed the condemnation of the ten generals. When
he could have escaped from prison, too, he would not. The
friends who wept at his fate he reproved, and while in prison he
composed those beautiful discourses.</p>

<p>He was also temperate and austere. Once, as Pamphila tells
us in the seventh book of her 'Commentaries,' Alcibiades offered
him a great estate, on which to build a house; and he said, "If
I needed sandals, and you offered me a hide from which to make
them for myself, I should be laughed at if I took it." Often,
too, beholding the multitude of things for sale, he would say to
himself, "How many things I do not need!" He used constantly
to repeat aloud these iambic verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But silver plate and garb of purple dye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To actors are of use,&mdash;but not in life."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He disdained the tyrants,&mdash;Archelaus of Macedon, Scopas of
Crannon, Eurylochus of Melissa,&mdash;not accepting gifts from them
nor visiting them. He was so regular in his way of living that
he was frequently the only one not ill when Athens was attacked
by the plague.</p>

<p>Aristotle says he wedded two wives, the first Xanthippe,
who bore him Lamprocles, and the second Myrto, daughter of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4715" id="Page_4715">[Pg 4715]</a></span>
Aristides the Just, whom he received without dowry and by
whom he had Sophroniscus and Menexenus. Some however say
he married Myrto first; and some again that he had them both
at once, as the Athenians on account of scarcity of men passed
a law to increase the population, permitting any one to marry
one Athenian woman and have children by another; so Socrates
did this.</p>

<p>He was a man also able to disdain those who mocked him.
He prided himself on his simple manner of living, and never
exacted any pay. He used to say he who ate with best appetite
had least need of delicacies, and he who drank with best appetite
had least need to seek a draught not at hand; and that he who
had fewest needs was nearest the gods. This indeed we may
learn from the comic poets, who in their very ridicule covertly
praise him. Thus Aristophanes says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O thou who hast righteously set thy heart on attaining to noble wisdom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How happy the life thou wilt lead among the Athenians and the Hellenes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrewdness and memory both are thine, and energy unwearied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mind; and never art thou tired from standing or from walking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By cold thou art not vexed at all, nor dost thou long for breakfast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wine thou dost shun, and gluttony, and every other folly."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ameipsias also, bringing him upon the stage in the philosopher's
cloak, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Socrates, best among few men, most foolish of many, thou also<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art come unto us; thou'rt a patient soul; but where didst get that doublet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wretched thing in mockery was presented by the cobblers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet though so hungry, he never however has stooped to flatter a mortal."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This disdain and arrogance in Socrates has also been exposed
by Aristophanes, who says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Along the streets you haughtily strut; your eyes roll hither and thither:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barefooted, enduring discomforts, you go with countenance solemn among us."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And yet sometimes, suiting himself to the occasion, he dressed
finely; as when for instance in Plato's 'Symposium' he goes to
Agathon's.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4716" id="Page_4716">[Pg 4716]</a></span>
He was a man able both to urge others to action, and to
dissuade them. Thus, when he conversed with The&aelig;tetus on
Knowledge, he sent him away inspired, as Plato says. Again,
when Euthyphron had indicted his own father for manslaughter,
by conversing with him on piety Socrates turned him from his
purpose. Lysis also by his exhortations he rendered a most
moral man. He was moreover skillful in fitting his arguments
to the circumstances. He changed the feeling of his son Lamprocles
when he was enraged with his mother, as Xenophon somewhere
relates. Plato's brother Glaucon, who wished to be active
in politics, he dissuaded because of his inexperience, as Xenophon
states; but Charmides on the other hand, who was well fitted,
he urged on. He roused the spirit of Iphicrates the general
also, pointing out to him the cocks of Midias the barber fighting
those of Callias. He said it was strange that every man could
tell easily how many sheep he had, but could not call by name
the friends whom he had acquired, so negligent were men in
that regard. Once seeing Euclid devoting great pains to captious
arguments, he said, "O Euclid, you will be able to manage
sophists&mdash;but men, never!" For he thought hair-splitting on
such matters useless, as Plato also says in his 'Euthydemus.'</p>

<p>When Glaucon offered him some slaves, so that he might
make a profit on them, he did not take them.</p>

<p>He praised leisure as the best of possessions, as Xenophon
also says in his 'Symposium.' He used to say, too, that there
was but one good&mdash;knowledge; and one evil&mdash;ignorance. Wealth
and birth, he said, had no value, but were on the contrary
wholly an evil. So when some one told him Antisthenes's mother
was a Thracian, "Did you think," quoth he, "so fine a man
must be the child of two Athenians?" When Phaedo had been
captured in war and shamefully enslaved, Socrates bade Crito
ransom him, and made him a philosopher.</p>

<p>He also learned, when already an old man, to play the lyre,
saying there was no absurdity in learning what one did not
know. He used to dance frequently, too, thinking this exercise
helpful to health. This Xenophon tells us in the 'Symposium.'</p>

<p>He used to say that his D&aelig;mon foretold future events: and
that he knew nothing, except that very fact that he did know
nothing. Those who bought at a great price what was out of
season, he said, had no hope of living till the season came around.
Once being asked what was virtue in a young man, he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4717" id="Page_4717">[Pg 4717]</a></span>
"To avoid excess in all things." He used to say one should study
geometry (surveying) just enough to be able to measure land in
buying and selling it.</p>

<p>When Euripides in the 'Auge' said of virtue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"These things were better left to lie untouched,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he rose up and left the theatre, saying it was absurd to think it
proper to seek for a slave if he was not to be found, but to let
virtue perish unregarded. When his advice was asked whether
to marry or not, he said, "Whichever you do, you will regret it!"
He used to say that he marveled that those who made stone
statues took pains to make the stone as like the man as possible,
but took none with themselves, that they might not be like the
stone. He thought it proper for the young to look constantly in
the mirror, so that if they had beauty they might prove themselves
worthy of it, and if they were ugly, that they might conceal
their ugliness by their accomplishments.</p>

<p>When he had invited rich friends to dinner, and Xanthippe was ashamed,
he said, "Do not be troubled. If they are sensible, they will bear
with us. If not, we shall care nothing for them." Most men, he said,
lived to eat; but he ate to live. As to those who showed regard for
the opinions of the ignoble multitude, he said it was as if a man
should reject one tetradrachm [coin] as worthless, but accept a heap
of such coins as good. When &AElig;schines said, "I am poor and have nothing
else, but I give you myself," he said, "Do you then not realize you
are offering me the greatest of gifts?" To him who said, "The
Athenians have condemned you to death," he responded, "And nature has
condemned them also thereto:" though some ascribe this to Anaxagoras.
When his wife exclaimed, "You die innocent!" he answered, "Do you wish
I were guilty?"</p>

<p>When a vision in sleep seemed to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Three days hence thou'lt come to the fertile region of Phthia,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he said to &AElig;schines, "On the third day I shall die." When he
was to drink the hemlock, Apollodorus gave him a fine garment
to die in: "But why," quoth he, "is this garment of mine good
enough to live in, but not to perish in?" To him who said,
"So-and-so speaks ill of you," he answered, "Yes, he has not
learned to speak well." When Antisthenes turned the ragged
side of his cloak to the light, he remarked, "I see your vanity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4718" id="Page_4718">[Pg 4718]</a></span>
through your cloak." He declared we ought to put ourselves
expressly at the service of the comedy writers: "For if they say
anything about us that is true, they will correct us; and if what
they say be untrue, it does not concern us at all."</p>

<p>When Xanthippe had first reviled him, then drenched him
with water, "Didn't I tell you," said he, "it was thundering and
would soon rain?" To Alcibiades, who said Xanthippe's scolding
was unbearable, he replied, "I am accustomed to it, as to a constantly
creaking pulley. And you," he added, "endure the cackling
of geese." Alcibiades said, "Yes, for they bring me eggs
and goslings." "And Xanthippe," retorted Socrates, "bears me
children." Once when she pulled off his cloak in the agora, his
friends advised him to defend himself with force. "Yes," said
he, "by Jove, so that as we fight, each of you may cry, 'Well
done, Socrates!' 'Good for you, Xanthippe!'" He used to say
he practiced on Xanthippe just as trainers do with spirited horses.
"Just as they if they master them are able to control any other
horse, so I who am accustomed to Xanthippe shall get on easily
with any one else."</p>

<p>It was for such words and acts as this that the Delphic priestess
bore witness in his honor, giving to Chairephon that famous
response:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wisest of all mankind is Socrates."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He became extremely unpopular on account of this oracle;
but also because he convicted of ignorance those who had a great
opinion of themselves, particularly Anytus, as Plato also says in
the 'Meno.' For Anytus, enraged at the ridicule Socrates brought
upon him, first urged Aristophanes and the rest on to attack
him, and then induced Meletus to join in indicting him for impiety
and for corrupting the young men. Plato in the 'Apology'
says there were three accusers,&mdash;Anytus, Lycon, and Meletus:
Anytus being incensed at him in behalf of the artisans and politicians,
Lycon for the orators, and Meletus for the poets, all of
whom Socrates pulled to pieces. The sworn statement of the
plaintiffs ran as follows; for it is still recorded, Favorinus says,
in the State archives:&mdash;"Socrates is guilty, not honoring the
gods whom the State honors, but introducing other strange divinities;
and he is further guilty of corrupting the young. Penalty,
death."</p>

<p>When Lysias wrote a speech for his defense, he read it, and
said, "A fine speech, Lysias, but not suited to me;" for indeed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4719" id="Page_4719">[Pg 4719]</a></span>
it was rather a lawyer's plea than a philosopher's. Lysias said,
"But why, if the speech is a fine one, should it not be suitable
for you?" Socrates replied, "Would not fine robes, then, and
sandals, be unfitting for me?"</p>

<p>While he was on trial, it is stated that Plato ascended the
<i>bema</i> and began, "Being the youngest, O men of Athens, of all
who ever came upon the bema"&mdash;but at this point the judges
cried out, "Come down! come down!" So he was convicted by
two hundred and eighty-one votes more than were cast for his
acquittal. And when the judges considered what penalty or fine
he should receive, he said he would pay five-and-twenty drachm&aelig;.
Euboulides says he agreed to pay a hundred, but when the
judges expressed their indignation aloud, he said, "For what I
have done, I consider the proper return to be support at the
public expense in the town hall." But they condemned him to
death, the vote being larger than before by eighty.</p>

<p>Not many days later he drank the hemlock in the prison,
after uttering many noble words, recorded by Plato in the
'Ph&aelig;do.' According to some, he wrote a poem beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Greeting, Apollo of Delos, and Artemis, youthful and famous."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He also versified, not very successfully, a fable of &AElig;sop's
which began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&AElig;sop once to the people who dwell in the city of Corinth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, 'Let virtue be judged not by the popular voice.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So he passed from among men; but straightway the Athenians
repented of their action, so that they closed the gymnasia, and
exiling the other accusers, put Meletus to death. Socrates they
honored with a statue of bronze, the work of Lysippus, which
was set up in the Pompeion. Anytus in exile, entering Heraclea,
was warned out of town that very day.</p>

<p>The Athenians have had the same experience not only in Socrates's
case, but with many others. Indeed, it is stated that they
fined Homer as a madman, and adjudged Tyrt&aelig;us to be crazy.
Euripides reproves them in the 'Palamedes,' saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ye have slain, ye have slain the all-wise,
the harmless nightingaleof the Muses."</p></div>

<p>That is so. But Philochorus says Euripides died before Socrates.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4720" id="Page_4720">[Pg 4720]</a></span>
Socrates and Euripides were both disciples of Anaxagoras.
It appears to me, too, that Socrates did talk on natural philosophy.
In fact, Xenophon says so, though he states that Socrates
held discourse only upon moral questions. Plato indeed, in the
'Apology,' mentioning Anaxagoras and other natural philosophers,
himself says of them things whereof Socrates denies any knowledge;
yet it is all ascribed to Socrates.</p>

<p>Aristotle states that a certain mage from Syria came to
Athens, and among other prophecies concerning Socrates foretold
that his death would be a violent one.</p>

<p>The following verses upon him are our own:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Drink, in the palace of Zeus, O Socrates, seeing that truly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou by a god wert called wise, who is wisdom itself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foolish Athenians, who to thee offered the potion of hemlock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through thy lips themselves draining the cup to the dregs!<br /></span>

<p>Once he was on a voyage with some impious men. The vessel was
overtaken by a storm, and they began to call upon the gods for aid.
But Bias said, "Be silent, so they may not discover that you are
aboard our ship!"</p>

<p>He declared it was pleasanter to decide a dispute between his enemies
than between friends. "For of two friends," he explained, "one is sure
to become my enemy; but of two enemies I make one friend."</p>


<h4><a name="Plato" id="Plato"></a><span class="smcap">Plato</span></h4>

<p>It is said Socrates, in a dream, seemed to be holding on his
knees a cygnet, which suddenly grew wings and flew aloft, singing
sweetly. Next day Plato came to him; and Socrates said he
was the bird.</p>

<p>It is told that Plato, once seeing a man playing at dice,
reproved him. "The stake is but a trifle," said the other. "Yes,
but," responded Plato, "the habit is no trifle."</p>

<p>Once when Xenocrates came into Plato's house, the latter
bade him scourge his slave for him, explaining that he could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4721" id="Page_4721">[Pg 4721]</a></span>
do it himself, because he was angry. Again, he said to one

angry."</p>


<h4><a name="Aristippus" id="Aristippus"></a><span class="smcap">Aristippus</span></h4>

<p>Dionysius once asked him why it is that the philosophers are
seen at rich men's doors, not the rich men at the doors of the
sages. Aristippus replied, "Because the wise realize what they
lack, but the rich do not." On a repetition of the taunt on another
occasion he retorted, "Yes, and physicians are seen at sick
men's doors; yet none would choose to be the patient rather than
the leech!"</p>

<p>Once when overtaken by a storm on a voyage to Corinth, he
was badly frightened. Somebody said to him, "We ordinary folk
are not afraid, but you philosophers play the coward." "Yes,"
was his reply, "we are not risking the loss of any such wretched
life as yours."</p>

<p>Some one reproached him for his extravagance in food. He
answered, "If you could buy these same things for threepence,
wouldn't you do it?"&mdash;"Oh yes."&mdash;"Why then, 'tis not I who
am too fond of the luxurious food, but you that are over-fond of
your money!"</p>

<p>When asked, "What is Hope?" he answered, "The dream of

"Gratitude." When told that some one had slandered him in
his absence, he said, "He may beat me too&mdash;in my absence!"
Being asked how much advantage the educated have over the
ignorant, he replied, "As much as the living over the dead."</p>

<p>Some one asked him why we spend much time in the society
of the beautiful. "That," he said, "is a proper question for a
blind man!" [<i>Cf.</i> Emerson's 'Rhodora.']</p>

<p>Once being asked how we should treat our friends, he said,
"As we would wish them to treat us." Asked what a friend is,
he answered, "One soul abiding in two bodies."</p>

<p>Some one asked him what he gained from philosophy. He
replied, "The power to converse with myself."</p>

<p>He advised the Athenians to pass a vote that asses were
horses. When they thought that irrational, he said, "But certainly,
your generals are not such because they have learned anything,
but simply because you have elected them!"</p>


<h4><a name="Diogenes" id="Diogenes"></a><span class="smcap">Diogenes</span></h4>

<p>He used to say that when in the course of his life he saw
pilots, and physicians, and philosophers, he thought man the most
sensible of animals; but when he saw interpreters of dreams, and
soothsayers, and those who paid attention to them, and those
puffed up by fame or wealth, he believed no creature was sillier
than man.</p>

<p>Some said to him, "You are an old man. Take life easy
now." He replied, "And if I were running the long-distance
race, should I when nearing the goal slacken, and not rather
exert myself?"</p>

<p>When he saw a child drink out of his hands, he took the cup
out of his wallet and flung it away, saying, "A child has beaten
me in simplicity."</p>

<p>He used to argue thus, "All things belong to the gods. The
wise are the friends of the gods. The goods of friends are common
property. Therefore all things belong to the wise."</p>

<p>To one who argued that <i>motion</i> was impossible, he made no

When the Athenians urged him to be initiated into the Mysteries,
assuring him that in Hades those who were initiated have
the front seats, he replied, "It is ludicrous, if Agesilaus and
Epaminondas are to abide in the mud, and some ignoble wretches
who are initiated are to dwell in the Isles of the Blest!"</p>

<p>Plato made the definition "Man is a two-footed featherless
animal," and was much praised for it. Diogenes plucked a fowl
and brought it into his school, saying "This is Plato's man!"
So the addition was made to the definition, "with broad nails."</p>

<p>When a man asked him what was the proper hour for lunch,
he said, "If you are rich, when you please; if you are poor,
when you can get it."</p>

<p>He used often to shout aloud that an easy life had been given
by the gods to men, but they had covered it from sight in their
search for honey-cakes and perfumes and such things.</p>

<p>The musician who was always left alone by his hearers he
greeted with "Good morning, cock!" When the other asked
him the reason, he said, "Because your music starts everybody
up."</p>

<p>When an exceedingly superstitious man said to him, "With
one blow I will break your head!" he retorted, "And with a
sneeze at your left side I will make you tremble."</p>

<p>When asked what animal had the worst bite, he said, "Of
wild beasts, the sycophant; and of tame creatures, the flatterer."</p>

<p>Being asked when was the proper time to marry, he responded,
"For young men, not yet; and for old men, not at all."</p>

<p>When he was asked what sort of wine he enjoyed drinking, he answered,
"Another man's." [Of a different temper was Dante, who knew too well
"how salt the bread of others tastes!"]</p>

<p>Some one advised him to hunt up his runaway slave. But
he replied, "It is ridiculous if Manes lives without Diogenes, but
Diogenes cannot without Manes."</p>

<p>When asked why men give to beggars, but not to philosophers,
he said, "Because they expect themselves to become lame
and blind; but philosophers, never!"</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">mong the writers whose education and whose tastes were the outcome
of the classicism of the eighteenth century, yet whose literary life
lapped over into the Victorian epoch, was Isaac D'Israeli, born at
Enfield in May 1766. D'Israeli was of Jewish origin, his ancestors
having fled from the Spanish persecutions of the fifteenth century to
find a home in Venice, whence a younger branch migrated to England.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Isaac D'Israeli</span></span>
</div>

<p>At the time of his birth his family had stood for generations among
the foremost English Jews, his father having been made a citizen by
special legislation. The boy, however, did not inherit the commercial
spirit which had established his house. He was a lover of books and a
dreamer of dreams, and so early developed literary tendencies that his
frightened father sent him off to Amsterdam to school, in the hope of
curing proclivities so dangerous. Here he became familiar with the
works of the Encyclop&aelig;dists, and adopted the theories of Rousseau. On
returning to England in his nineteenth year, he replied to his
father's proposition that he should enter a commercial house at
Bordeaux, by a long poem in which he passionately inveighed against
the commercial spirit, and avowed himself a student of philosophy and
letters. His father's reluctant acquiescence was obtained at last
through the good offices of the laureate Pye, to whom the youth had
already dedicated his first book, 'A Defence of Poetry.'</p>

<p>At the outset of his career he found himself received with
consideration by the men whose acquaintance he most desired. Following
the fashion of the day, and inspired by the books of anecdotes so
successfully published by his friend Douce, D'Israeli in 1791 produced
anonymously a small volume entitled 'Curiosities of Literature,' the
copyright of which he magnanimously presented to his publisher. The
extraordinary success of this book can be accounted for only by the
curious taste of the time, which still reflected the more unworthy
traditions of the Addisonian era. It was an age of clubs and
tea-tables, of society scandal-mongering and fireside gossip;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4726" id="Page_4726">[Pg 4726]</a></span>
and the reading public welcomed a contribution whose refined dilettantism
so well matched its own. The mysteries of Eleusis and the origin of wigs
received the same grave attention. This popularity induced D'Israeli
to buy back the copyright at a generous valuation; he enlarged the
work to five volumes, which passed through twelve in his own lifetime,
and still serves to illustrate a curious literary phase.</p>

<p>Other compilations of similar nature met the same success: 'The
Calamities of Authors,' 'Quarrels of Authors,' and 'Literary
Recollections'; but the 'Amenities of Literature,' his last work, is
the most purely literary in form, and affords perhaps the best index
to D'Israeli's abilities as a writer. The reader of to-day, however,
is struck by the ephemeral nature of this criticism, which yet by a
curious literary experience is keeping a place among the permanent
productions of its age. The reader is everywhere impressed by the
human sympathy, by the wide if rather superficial knowledge, and by
innumerable felicities of expression and style, which betray the
cultivated mind. To lovers of the curious the books still appeal, and
they will continue to hold an honorable place among the bric-a-brac of
literature.</p>

<p>The spirit of curiosity which characterized the mind of D'Israeli
assumed its most dignified concrete form in the 'Commentaries on
the Reign of Charles I.' D'Israeli had an artistic sense of the values
in a historical picture, with a keen perception of the importance of
side lights; and although the book is not a great contribution to the
literature of history, yet it became popular, and in July 1832 earned
for its author the degree of D.C.L. from Oxford.</p>

<p>D'Israeli's romances were tedious tales, but his hold upon the public
was secure, and the vast amount of miscellaneous matter which
he published always found a delighted audience. 'The Genius of
Judaism,' a philosophical inquiry into the historical significance of
the permanence of the Jewish race, showed the author's psychic limitations.
He designed a history of English literature, for which he
had gathered much material, but increasing blindness forced him to
abandon it. Much of D'Israeli's popularity was unquestionably due
to his qualities of heart. His nature was fine; he was an affectionate
and devoted friend, and held an enviable position in the literary circles
of the day. Campbell, Byron, Rogers, and Scott alike admired
and loved him, while a host of lesser men eagerly sought his friendship.</p>

<p>Although brought up in the Jewish faith, D'Israeli affiliated early
in life with the Church of England, in which his three sons and one
daughter were baptized. He died in 1848, and was buried at Brandenham.
Twenty years later his daughter-in-law, the Countess of
Beaconsfield, erected at Hughenden a monument to his memory.</p>

<h3><a name="POETS_PHILOSOPHERS_AND_ARTISTS_MADE_BY_ACCIDENT" id="POETS_PHILOSOPHERS_AND_ARTISTS_MADE_BY_ACCIDENT"></a>POETS, PHILOSOPHERS, AND ARTISTS MADE BY ACCIDENT</h3>

<h4>From 'Curiosities of Literature'</h4>


<p>Accident has frequently occasioned the most eminent geniuses to
display their powers. It was at Rome, says Gibbon, on the fifteenth of
October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while
the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter,
that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first
started to my mind.</p>

<p>Father Malebranche, having completed his studies in philosophy and
theology without any other intention than devoting himself to some
religious order, little expected the celebrity his works acquired for
him. Loitering in an idle hour in the shop of a bookseller, and
turning over a parcel of books, 'L'Homme de Descartes' fell into his
hands. Having dipt into some parts, he read with such delight that the
palpitations of his heart compelled him to lay the volume down. It was
this circumstance that produced those profound contemplations which
made him the Plato of his age.</p>

<p>Cowley became a poet by accident. In his mother's apartment he found,
when very young, Spenser's 'Fairy Queen,' and by a continual study of
poetry he became so enchanted of the Muse that he grew irrecoverably a
poet.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson informs us that Sir Joshua Reynolds had the first fondness
of his art excited by the perusal of Richardson's Treatise.</p>

<p>Vaucanson displayed an uncommon genius for mechanics.
His taste was first determined by an accident: when young, he
frequently attended his mother to the residence of her confessor;
and while she wept with repentance, he wept with weariness! In
this state of disagreeable vacation, says Helvetius, he was struck
with the uniform motion of the pendulum of the clock in the
hall. His curiosity was roused; he approached the clock-case,
and studied its mechanism; what he could not discover he
guessed at. He then projected a similar machine, and gradually
his genius produced a clock. Encouraged by this first success, he
proceeded in his various attempts; and the genius which thus
could form a clock, in time formed a fluting automaton.</p>

<p>If Shakespeare's imprudence had not obliged him to quit his
wool trade and his town; if he had not engaged with a company
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4728" id="Page_4728">[Pg 4728]</a></span>
of actors, and at length, disgusted with being an indifferent performer, he had
not turned author, the prudent wool-seller had never been the celebrated poet.</p>

<p>Accident determined the taste of Moli&egrave;re for the stage. His
grandfather loved the theatre, and frequently carried him there. The
young man lived in dissipation; the father, observing it, asked in
anger if his son was to be made an actor. "Would to God," replied the
grandfather, "he was as good an actor as Montrose." The words struck
young Moli&egrave;re; he took a disgust to his tapestry trade; and it is to
this circumstance France owes her greatest comic writer.</p>

<p>Corneille loved; he made verses for his mistress, became a poet,
composed 'M&eacute;lite,' and afterwards his other celebrated works. The
discreet Corneille had remained a lawyer.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the devotion of a mother, the death of Cromwell,
deer-stealing, the exclamation of an old man, and the beauty of a
woman, have given five illustrious characters to Europe.</p>

<p>We owe the great discovery of Newton to a very trivial accident. When
a student at Cambridge, he had retired during the time of the plague
into the country. As he was reading under an apple-tree, one of the
fruit fell, and struck him a smart blow on the head. When he observed
the smallness of the apple, he was surprised at the force of the
stroke. This led him to consider the accelerating motion of falling
bodies; from whence he deduced the principle of gravity, and laid the
foundation of his philosophy.</p>

<p>Ignatius Loyola was a Spanish gentleman who was dangerously wounded at
the siege of Pampeluna. Having heated his imagination by reading the
Lives of the Saints, which were brought to him in his illness instead
of a romance, he conceived a strong ambition to be the founder of a
religious order; whence originated the celebrated society of the
Jesuits.</p>

<p>Rousseau found his eccentric powers first awakened by the
advertisement of the singular annual subject which the Academy of
Dijon proposed for that year, in which he wrote his celebrated
Declamation against the arts and sciences; a circumstance which
determined his future literary efforts.</p>

<p>La Fontaine, at the age of twenty-two, had not taken any
profession or devoted himself to any pursuit. Having accidentally
heard some verses of Malherbe, he felt a sudden impulse, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4729" id="Page_4729">[Pg 4729]</a></span>
directed his future life. He immediately bought a Malherbe, and was so
exquisitely delighted with this poet that after passing the nights in
treasuring his verses in his memory, he would run in the daytime to the
woods, where, concealing himself, he would recite his verses to the
surrounding dryads.</p>

<p>Flamsteed was an astronomer by accident. He was taken from school on
account of his illness, when Sacrobosco's book 'De Sph&aelig;ra' having been
lent to him, he was so pleased with it that he immediately began a
course of astronomic studies. Pennant's first propensity to natural
history was the pleasure he received from an accidental perusal of
Willoughby's work on birds; the same accident, of finding on the table
of his professor Reaumur's 'History of Insects,'&mdash;of which he read
more than he attended to the lecture.&mdash;and having been refused the
loan, gave such an instant turn to the mind of Bonnet that he hastened
to obtain a copy, but found many difficulties in procuring this costly
work. Its possession gave an unalterable direction to his future life:
this naturalist indeed lost the use of his sight by his devotion to
the microscope.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin attributes the cast of his genius to a similar accident.
"I found a work of Defoe's, entitled an 'Essay on Projects,' from
which perhaps I derived impressions that have since influenced some of
the principal events of my life."</p>

<p>I shall add the incident which occasioned Roger Ascham to write his
'Schoolmaster,' one of the most curious and useful treatises among our
elder writers.</p>

<p>At a dinner given by Sir William Cecil during the plague in 1563, at
his apartments at Windsor, where the Queen had taken refuge, a number
of ingenious men were invited. Secretary Cecil communicated the news
of the morning, that several scholars at Eton had run away on account
of their master's severity, which he condemned as a great error in the
education of youth. Sir William Petre maintained the contrary; severe
in his own temper, he pleaded warmly in defense of hard flogging. Dr.
Wootton, in softer tones, sided with the Secretary. Sir John Mason,
adopting no side, bantered both. Mr. Haddon seconded the hard-hearted
Sir William Petre, and adduced as an evidence that the best schoolmaster
then in England was the hardest flogger. Then was it that Roger Ascham
indignantly exclaimed that if such a master had an able scholar it was owing
to the boy's genius and not the preceptor's rod. Secretary Cecil and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4730" id="Page_4730">[Pg 4730]</a></span>
others were pleased with Ascham's notions. Sir Richard Sackville was
silent; but when Ascham after dinner went to the Queen to read one of
the orations of Demosthenes, he took him aside, and frankly told him
that though he had taken no part in the debate he would not have been
absent from that conversation for a great deal; that he knew to his
cost the truth Ascham had supported, for it was the perpetual flogging
of such a schoolmaster that had given him an unconquerable aversion to
study. And as he wished to remedy this defect in his own children, he
earnestly exhorted Ascham to write his observations on so interesting
a topic. Such was the circumstance which produced the admirable
treatise of Roger Ascham.</p>

<h3><a name="MARTYRDOM" id="MARTYRDOM"></a>THE MARTYRDOM OF CHARLES THE FIRST</h3>

<h4>From the 'Commentaries on the Reign of Charles the First'</h4>

<p>At Whitehall a repast had been prepared. The religious emotions of
Charles had consecrated the sacrament, which he refused to mingle with
human food. The Bishop, whose mind was unequal to conceive the
intrepid spirit of the King, dreading lest the magnanimous monarch,
overcome by the severity of the cold, might faint on the scaffold,
prevailed on him to eat half a manchet of bread and taste some claret.
But the more consolatory refreshment of Charles had been just imparted
to him in that singular testimony from his son, who had sent a <i>carte
blanche</i> to save the life of his father at any price. This was a
thought on which his affections could dwell in face of the scaffold
which he was now to ascend.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="CHARLES" id="CHARLES"></a>
<span class="caption"><i>CHARLES I. GOING TO EXECUTION.</i><br />

<img src="images/Illus0421.jpg" width="635" height="400" alt="CHARLES I. GOING TO EXECUTION." title="CHARLES I. GOING TO EXECUTION." />
</div>

<p>Charles had arrived at Whitehall about ten o'clock, and was not led to
the scaffold till past one. It was said that the scaffold was not
completed; it might have been more truly said that the conspirators
were not ready. There was a mystery in this delay. The fate of Charles
the First to the very last moment was in suspense. Fairfax, though at
the time in the palace, inquired of Herbert how the King was, when the
King was no more! and expressed his astonishment on hearing that the
execution had just taken place. This extraordinary simplicity and
abstraction from the present scene of affairs has been imputed to the
General as an act of refined dissimulation, yet this seems uncertain.
The Prince's <i>carte blanche</i> had been that morning confided to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4731" id="Page_4731">[Pg 4731]</a></span>
hands, and he surely must have laid it before the "Grandees of the
Army," as this new order of the rulers of England was called. Fairfax,
whose personal feelings respecting the King were congenial with those
his lady had so memorably evinced, labored to defer for a few days the
terrible catastrophe; not without the hope of being able, by his own
regiment and others in the army, to prevent the deed altogether. It is
probable&mdash;inexplicable as it may seem to us&mdash;that the execution of
Charles the First really took place unknown to the General. Fairfax
was not unaccustomed to discover that his colleagues first acted, and
afterwards trusted to his own discernment.</p>

<p>Secret history has not revealed all that passed in those three
awful hours. We know, however, that the warrant for the execution
was not signed till within a few minutes before the King
was led to the scaffold. In an apartment in the Palace, Ireton and
Harrison were in bed together, and Cromwell, with four colonels,
assembled in it. Colonel Huncks refused to sign the warrant.
Cromwell would have no further delay, reproaching the Colonel
as "a peevish, cowardly fellow," and Colonel Axtell declared that
he was ashamed for his friend Huncks, remonstrating with him,
that "the ship is coming into the harbor, and now would he
strike sail before we come to anchor?" Cromwell stepped to a
table, and wrote what he had proposed to Huncks; Colonel
Hacker, supplying his place, signed it, and with the ink hardly
dry, carried the warrant in his hand and called for the King.</p>

<p>At the fatal summons Charles rose with alacrity. The King
passed through the long gallery by a line of soldiers. Awe and
sorrow seem now to have mingled in their countenances. Their
barbarous commanders were intent on their own triumph, and
no farther required the forced cry of "Justice and Execution."
Charles stepped out of an enlarged window of the Banqueting
House, where a new opening leveled it with the scaffold. Charles
came forward with the same indifference as "he would have
entered Whitehall on a masque night," as an intelligent observer
described. The King looked towards St. James's and smiled.
Curious eyes were watchful of his slightest motions; and the
Commonwealth papers of the day express their surprise, perhaps
their vexation, at the unaltered aspect and the firm step of the
Monarch. These mean spirits had flattered themselves that he
who had been cradled in royalty, who had lived years in the
fields of honor, and was now, they presumed, a recreant in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4732" id="Page_4732">[Pg 4732]</a></span>
imprisonment,&mdash;"the grand Delinquent of England,"&mdash;as they
called him, would start in horror at the block.</p>

<p>This last triumph at least was not reserved for them,&mdash;it was
for the King. Charles, dauntless, strode "the floor of Death," to
use Fuller's peculiar but expressive phraseology. He looked on
the block with the axe lying upon it, with attention; his only
anxiety was that the block seemed not sufficiently raised, and
that the edge of the axe might be turned by being swept by the
flappings of cloaks, or blunted by the feet of some moving about
the scaffold. "Take care they do not put me to pain!&mdash;Take
heed of the axe! take heed of the axe!" exclaimed the King to
a gentleman passing by. "Hurt not the axe; that may hurt
me!" His continued anxiety concerning these <i>circumstances</i>
proves that he felt not the terror of death, solely anxious to
avoid the pain, for he had an idea of their cruelty. With that
sedate thoughtfulness which was in all his actions, he only looked
at the business of the hour. One circumstance Charles observed
with a smile. They had a notion that the King would resist the
executioner; on the suggestion of Hugh Peters, it is said, they
had driven iron staples and ropes into the scaffold, that their
victim, if necessary, might be bound down upon the block.</p>

<p>The King's speech has many remarkable points, but certainly
nothing so remarkable as the place where it was delivered. This
was the first "King's Speech" spoken from a scaffold. Time
shall confirm, as history has demonstrated, his principle that
"They mistook the nature of government; for people are free
under a government, not by being sharers in it, but by the due
administration of the laws." "It was for this," said Charles,
"that now I am come here. If I could have given way to an
arbitrary sway, for to have all laws changed according to the
power of the sword, I need not have come here; and therefore
I tell you that I am <i>the Martyr of the People</i>!"</p>

<h2><a name="SYDNEY_DOBELL" id="SYDNEY_DOBELL"></a>SYDNEY DOBELL</h2>

<h4>(1824-1874)</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/caps67.png" width="90" height="90" alt="S" title="S" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ydney Dobell, the son of a wine merchant, was born at Cranbrook in
Kent. His parents, both persons of strong individuality, believed in
home training, and not one of their eight children went either to
school or to university. They belonged to the Broad Church Community
founded by Sydney's maternal grandfather, Samuel Thompson; a church
intended to recall in its principles the primitive Christian ages. The
parents looked upon Sydney, their eldest-born, as destined to become
the apostle of this creed. He grew up in a kind of religious fervor,
with his precocious mind unnaturally stimulated; a course of conduct
which materially weakened his constitution, and made him a chronic
invalid at the early age of thirty-three. He read whatever books came
to hand, many of them far beyond his years. At the age of eight he
filled his diary with theological discussions.</p>

<p>Entering his father's counting-house as a mere lad, he remained to the
end of his life a business man of great energy. Notwithstanding his
rare poetic endowments, he never seems to have entertained a
single-minded purpose to be a poet and nothing more. On the contrary,
he thought the ideal and the practical life perfectly compatible, and
he strove to unite in himself the poet and the man of affairs. He
wrote habitually until 1856, when regular literary work was forbidden
by his physicians. With characteristic energy he now turned his
thoughts into other channels; identified himself with the affairs of
Gloucester, where he was living, looked after his business, and was
one of the first to adopt the system of industrial co-operation. The
last four years of his life, a period of suffering and helplessness,
he spent at Barton-End House, above the Stroud valley, where he died
in the spring of 1874.</p>

<p>In the work of Dobell it is curious to find so few traces of the
influences under which he grew up. He had every encouragement to
become a writer of religious poetry; yet much of his work is
philosophic and recondite. His delicate health is in a measure
responsible for his failure to achieve the success which his natural
endowments promised. All his literary work was done between the ages
of twenty-three and thirty-three. 'The Roman,' his first long poem,
appeared in 1850. Dedicated to the Italian struggle for liberty, it
showed his breadth of sympathy. In 'Balder,' finished in 1853,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4734" id="Page_4734">[Pg 4734]</a></span>
Dobell is at his best both as thinker and as poet. Yet its many fine
passages, its wealth of metaphor, and the exquisite songs of Amy,
hardly counterbalance the remoteness of its theme, and its over-subtle
analysis of morbid psychic states. It is a poem to be read in
fragments, and has aptly been called a mine for poets.</p>

<p>With Alexander Smith he published in 1855 a series of sonnets inspired
by the Crimean War. This was followed in 1856 by 'England in War
Time,' a collection of Dobell's lyrical and descriptive poems, which
possess more general human interest than any other of his books.</p>

<p>After continuous work was interdicted, he still contributed verse and
prose to the periodicals. His essays have been collected by Professor
Nichol, under the title 'Thoughts on Art, Philosophy, and Religion.'
As a poet Dobell belongs to the so-called "spasmodic school," a school
"characterized by an undercurrent of discontent with the mystery of
existence, by vain effort, unrewarded struggle, skeptical unrest, and
an uneasy striving after some incomprehensible end.... Poetry of this
kind is marked by an excess of metaphor which darkens rather than
illustrates, and by a general extravagance of language. On the other
hand, it manifests freshness and originality, and a rich natural
beauty." Dobell's descriptions of scenery are among the finest in
English literature. His senses were abnormally acute, like those of a
savage, a condition which intensified his appreciation of natural
beauty. Possessing a vivid imagination and wide sympathies, he was
often over-subtle and obscure. He strove to realize in himself his
ideal of a poet, and during his years of ill-health gave himself up to
promoting the welfare of his fellow-men; but of his seventeen years of
inactivity he says:&mdash;"The keen perception of all that should be done,
and that so bitterly cries for doing, accompanies the consciousness of
all that I might but cannot do."</p>

<h2><a name="AUSTIN_DOBSON" id="AUSTIN_DOBSON"></a>AUSTIN DOBSON</h2>

<h4>(1840-)</h4>

<h4>BY ESTHER SINGLETON</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/capa75.png" width="90" height="90" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">t first thought it seems difficult to consider Austin Dobson as
belonging to the Victorian period, so entirely is he saturated with
the spirit of the eighteenth century. A careful study of his verse
reveals the fact that the Georgian era, seen through the vista of his
poetic imagination, is divested of all that is coarse, dark, gross,
and prosaic. The mental atmosphere and the types and characters that
he gives, express only beauty and charm.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/Illus075.png" width="180" height="220" alt="Austin Dobson" title="Austin Dobson" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Austin Dobson</span></span>
</div>

<p>One approaches the poems of Austin Dobson
as one stands before a rare collection
of enamels, fan-mounts, jeweled snuff-boxes,
and delicate carvings in ivory and silver; and
after delighting in the beauty and finish of
these graceful curios, passes into a gallery of
paintings and water-colors, suggesting Watteau,
Fragonard, Boucher, Meissonier, and
Greuze. We also wander among trim box-hedges
and quaint gardens of roses and bright
hollyhocks; lean by sun-dials to watch the
shadow of Time; and enjoy the sight of gay
belles, patched and powdered and dressed in
brocaded gowns and gypsy hats. Gallant
beaux, such as are associated with Reynolds's
portraits, appear, and hand them into sedan-chairs or lead them
through stately minuets to the notes of Rameau, Couperin, and Arne.</p>

<p>Just as the scent of rose-leaves, lavender, and musk rises from
antique Chinese jars, so Dobson's delicate verse reconstructs a life</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of fashion gone, and half-forgotten ways."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He is equally at home in France. Nothing could be more sympathetic
and exquisite than 'A Revolutionary Relic,' 'The Cur&eacute;'s
Progress,' 'Une Marquise,' and the 'Proverbs in Porcelain,' one of
which is cited below.</p>

<p>In the 'Vers de Soci&eacute;t&eacute;,' as well as his other poetry, Dobson
fulfills all the requirements of light verse&mdash;charm, mockery, pathos,
banter, and, while apparently skimming the surface, often shows us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4742" id="Page_4742">[Pg 4742]</a></span>
the strange depths of the human heart. He blends so many qualities
that he deserves the praise of T.B. Aldrich, who says, "Austin
Dobson has the grace of Suckling and the finish of Herrick, and is
easily master of both in metrical art."</p>

<p>Henry Austin Dobson, the son of Mr. George Clarisse Dobson, a civil
engineer, was born in Plymouth, England, January 18th 1840. His early
years were spent in Anglesea, and after receiving his education in
Beaumaris, Coventry, and Strasburg, he returned to England to become a
civil engineer. In 1856 he entered the civil service of Great Britain,
and ever since that date he has held offices in the Board of Trade.
His leisure was devoted to literature, and when Anthony Trollope first
issued his magazine St. Paul's in 1868, he introduced to the public
the verse of Austin Dobson. In 1873 his fugitive poems were published
in a small volume entitled 'Vignettes in Rhyme' and 'Vers de Soci&eacute;t&eacute;.'
This was followed in 1877 by 'Proverbs in Porcelain,' and both books,
with additional poems, were printed again in two volumes: 'Old World
Idylls' (1883), and 'At the Sign of the Lyre' (1885). Mr. Dobson's
original essays are contained in three volumes: 'Four Frenchwomen,'
studies of Charlotte Corday, Madame Roland, the Princess de Lamballe,
and Madame de Genlis (1890), and 'Eighteenth-Century Vignettes' (first
series 1892, second series 1894), which touch upon a host of
picturesque and fascinating themes. He has written also several
biographies: of Hogarth, of Fielding, of Steele (1886), of Goldsmith
(1888), and a 'Memoir of Horace Walpole' (1890). He has also written
felicitous critical introductions to many new editions of the
eighteenth-century classics.</p>

<p>Austin Dobson has been most happy in breathing English life into
the old poems of French verse, such as ballades, villanelles, roundels,
and rondeaux; and he has also written clever and satirical
fables, cast in the form and temper of Gay and Prior, with quaint
obsolete affectations, redolent of the classic age of Anne.</p>

<p>So serious is his attitude towards art, and so large his audience,
that the hope expressed in the following rondeau will certainly be
realized:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PRINCESS_DE_LAMBALLE" id="THE_PRINCESS_DE_LAMBALLE"></a>THE PRINCESS DE LAMBALLE</h3>

<h4>From 'Four Frenchwomen'</h4>


<p>A tender wife, a loving daughter, and a loyal friend,&mdash;shall we not
here lay down upon the grave of Marie de Lamballe our reverential
tribute, our little chaplet of <i>immortelles</i>, in the name of all good
women, wives, and daughters?</p>

<p>"<i>Elle &eacute;tait mieux femme que les autres.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> To us that apparently
indefinite, exquisitely definite sentence most fitly marks
the distinction between the subjects of the two preceding papers
and the subject of the present. It is a transition from the
stately figure of a marble Agrippina to the breathing, feeling
woman at your side; it is the transition from the statuesque
Rachelesque heroines of a David to the "small sweet idyl" of
a Greuze. And, we confess it, we were not wholly at ease
with those tragic, majestic figures. We shuddered at the dagger
and the bowl which suited them so well. We marveled at their
bloodless serenity, their superhuman self-sufficiency; inly we
questioned if they breathed and felt. Or was their circulation a
matter of machinery&mdash;a mere dead-beat escapement? We longed
for the <i>sexe prononc&eacute;</i> of Rivarol&mdash;we longed for the showman's
"female woman!" We respected and we studied, but we did
not love them. With Madame de Lamballe the case is otherwise.
Not grand like this one, not heroic like that one, "<i>elle est
mieux femme que les autres</i>."</p>

<p>She at least is woman&mdash;after a fairer fashion&mdash;after a truer
type. Not intellectually strong like Manon Philipon, not Spartan-souled
like Marie de Corday, she has still a rare intelligence,
a courage of affection. She has that <i>clairvoyance</i> of the heart
which supersedes all the stimulants of mottoes from Reynel or
maxims from Rousseau; she has that "angel instinct" which is
a juster lawgiver than Justinian. It was thought praise to say
of the Girondist lady that she was a greater man than her husband;
it is praise to say of this queen's friend that she was
more woman than Madame Roland. Not so grand, not so great,
we like the princess best. <i>Elle est mieux femme que les autres.</i></p>

languages, be allotted the Montyon prize of 1500 francs for moral as
well as literary excellence, and be crowned by the French
Academy&mdash;this is a piece of good fortune which falls to the lot of few
story-tellers. The book which has deserved so well is 'Hans Brinker,
or The Silver Skates,' a story of life in Holland. Its author, born in
New York, is a daughter of Professor James Jay Mapes, an eminent
chemist and inventor, an accomplished writer and brilliant talker.</p>

<p>In a household where music, art, and
literature were cultivated, and where the
most agreeable society came, talents were
not likely to be overlooked. Mrs. Dodge,
very early widowed, began writing before
she was twenty, publishing short stories,
sketches, and poems in various periodicals.
'Hans Brinker' appeared in 1864,&mdash;her delight
in Motley's histories and their appeal
to her own Dutch blood inspiring her to
write it. Of this book Mr. Frank R. Stockton
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There are strong reasons why the fairest orange groves, the loftiest
mountain peaks, or the inspiriting waves of the rolling sea, could not
tempt average boys and girls from the level stretches of the Dutch
canals, until they had skated through the sparkling story, warmed with
a healthy glow.</p>

<p>"This is not only a tale of vivid description, interesting and
instructive; it is a romance. There are adventures, startling and
surprising, there are mysteries of buried gold, there are the
machinations of the wicked, there is the heroism of the good, and the
gay humor of happy souls. More than these, there is love&mdash;that
sentiment which glides into a good story as naturally as into a human
life; and whether the story be for old or young, this element gives it
an ever-welcome charm. Strange fortune and good fortune come to Hans
and to Gretel, and to many other deserving characters in the tale, but
there is nothing selfish about these heroes and heroines. As soon as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4758" id="Page_4758">[Pg 4758]</a></span>
a new generation of young people grows up to be old enough to enjoy
this perennial story, all these characters return to the days of their
youth, and are ready to act their parts again to the very end, and to
feel in their own souls, as everybody else feels, that their story is
just as new and interesting as when it was first told."</p></div>

<p>Besides this book, Mrs. Dodge has published several volumes of
juvenile verse, such as 'Rhymes and Jingles,' and 'When Life was
Young'; a volume of serious verse, 'Along the Way'; a volume of
satirical and humorous sketches, 'Theophilus and Others'; a second
successful story for young people, 'Donald and Dorothy,' and a
number of other works. Her stories evince an unusual faculty of
construction and marked inventiveness,&mdash;inherited perhaps from
her father,&mdash;truthful characterization, literary feeling, a strong sense
of humor, and a high ethical standard. Her whimsical character
sketch, 'Miss Maloney on the Chinese Question,' which has been
reprinted thousands of times and repeated by every elocutionist in
the land, is in its way as searching a satire as Bret Harte's 'Heathen
Chinee.'</p>

<p>Since its beginning in 1873, Mrs. Dodge has edited the St. Nicholas
Magazine, whose pages bear witness to her enormous industry.</p>

<h4>From 'Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates,' Copyright 1896, by Charles
Scribner's Sons</h4>


<p>The 20th of December came at last, bringing with it the perfection of
winter weather. All over the level landscape lay the warm sunlight.
It tried its power on lake, canal, and river; but the ice flashed
defiance, and showed no sign of melting. The very weathercocks stood
still to enjoy the sight. This gave the windmills a holiday. Nearly
all the past week they had been whirling briskly; now, being rather
out of breath, they rocked lazily in the clear still air. Catch a
windmill working when the weathercocks have nothing to do!</p>

<p>There was an end to grinding, crushing, and sawing for that
day. It was a good thing for the millers near Broek. Long
before noon, they concluded to take in their sails and go to
the race. Everybody would be there. Already the north side
of the frozen Y was bordered with eager spectators; the news
of the great skating-match had traveled far and wide. Men,
women, and children, in holiday attire, were flocking toward the
spot. Some wore furs and wintry cloaks or shawls; but many,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4759" id="Page_4759">[Pg 4759]</a></span>
consulting their feelings rather than the almanac, were dressed
as for an October day.</p>

<p>The site selected for the race was a faultless plain of ice near
Amsterdam, on that great <i>arm</i> of the Zuyder Zee, which Dutchmen of
course must call the Eye. The townspeople turned out in large numbers.
Strangers in the city deemed it a fine chance to see what was to be
seen. Many a peasant from the northward had wisely chosen the 20th as
the day for the next city-trading. It seemed that everybody, young and
old, who had wheels, skates, or feet at command, had hastened to the
scene.</p>

<p>There were the gentry in their coaches, dressed like Parisians fresh
from the Boulevards; Amsterdam children in charity uniforms; girls
from the Roman Catholic Orphan House, in sable gowns and white
head-bands; boys from the Burgher Asylum, with their black tights and
short-skirted harlequin coats. There were old-fashioned gentlemen in
cocked hats and velvet knee-breeches; old-fashioned ladies too, in
stiff quilted skirts and bodices of dazzling brocade. These were
accompanied by servants bearing foot-stoves and cloaks. There were the
peasant folk, arrayed in every possible Dutch costume,&mdash;shy young
rustics in brazen buckles; simple village maidens concealing their
flaxen hair under fillets of gold; women whose long narrow aprons were
stiff with embroidery; women with short corkscrew curls hanging over
their foreheads; women with shaved heads and close-fitting caps, and
women in striped skirts and windmill bonnets; men in leather, in
homespun, in velvet and broadcloth; burghers in modern European
attire, and burghers in short jackets, wide trousers, and
steeple-crowned hats.</p>

<p>There were beautiful Friesland girls in wooden shoes and coarse
petticoats, with solid gold crescents encircling their heads, finished
at each temple with a golden rosette, and hung with lace a century
old. Some wore necklaces, pendants, and earrings of the purest gold.
Many were content with gilt, or even with brass; but it is not an
uncommon thing for a Friesland woman to have all the family treasure
in her headgear. More than one rustic lass displayed the value of two
thousand guilders upon her head that day.</p>

<p>Scattered throughout the crowd were peasants from the
Island of Marken, with sabots, black stockings, and the widest
of breeches; also women from Marken, with short blue petticoats,
and black jackets gayly figured in front. They wore red sleeves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4760" id="Page_4760">[Pg 4760]</a></span>
white aprons, and a cap like a bishop's mitre over their golden hair.</p>

<p>The children often were as quaint and odd-looking as their elders. In
short, one-third of the crowd seemed to have stepped bodily from a
collection of Dutch paintings.</p>

<p>Everywhere could be seen tall women and stumpy men, lively-faced
girls, and youths whose expressions never changed from sunrise to
sunset.</p>

<p>There seemed to be at least one specimen from every known town in
Holland. There were Utrecht water-bearers, Gouda cheese-makers, Delft
pottery-men, Schiedam distillers, Amsterdam diamond-cutters, Rotterdam
merchants, dried-up herring-packers, and two sleepy-eyed shepherds
from Texel. Every man of them had his pipe and tobacco pouch. Some
carried what might be called the smoker's complete outfit,&mdash;a pipe,
tobacco, a pricker with which to clean the tube, a silver net for
protecting the bowl, and a box of the strongest of brimstone matches.</p>

<p>A true Dutchman, you must remember, is rarely without his pipe on any
possible occasion. He may for a moment neglect to breathe; but when
the pipe is forgotten, he must be dying indeed. There were no such sad
cases here. Wreaths of smoke were rising from every possible quarter.
The more fantastic the smoke-wreath, the more placid and solemn the
smoker.</p>

<p>Look at those boys and girls on stilts! That is a good idea.
They can look over the heads of the tallest. It is strange to see
those little bodies high in the air, carried about on mysterious
legs. They have such a resolute look on their round faces, what
wonder that nervous old gentlemen with tender feet wince and
tremble while the long-legged little monsters stride past them!</p>

<p>You will read in certain books that the Dutch are a quiet
people. So they are, generally. But listen! did you ever hear
such a din? All made up of human voices&mdash;no, the horses are
helping somewhat, and the fiddles are squeaking pitifully; (how
it must pain fiddles to be tuned!) but the mass of the sound
comes from the great <i>vox humana</i> that belongs to a crowd.</p>

<p>That queer little dwarf, going about with a heavy basket,
winding in and out among the people, helps not a little. You
can hear his shrill cry above all other sounds, "Pypen en tabac!
Pypen en tabac!"</p>

<p>Another, his big brother, though evidently some years younger,
is selling doughnuts and bonbons. He is calling on all pretty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4761" id="Page_4761">[Pg 4761]</a></span>
children, far and near, to come quickly or the cakes will be
gone.</p>

<p>You know quite a number among the spectators. High up
in yonder pavilion, erected upon the border of the ice, are some
persons whom you have seen very lately. In the centre is
Madame Van Gleck. It is her birthday, you remember; she has
the post of honor. There is Mynheer Van Gleck, whose meerschaum
has not really grown fast to his lips; it only appears so.
There are Grandfather and Grandmother, whom you met at the
St. Nicholas f&ecirc;te. All the children are with them. It is so
mild, they have brought even the baby. The poor little creature
is swaddled very much after the manner of an Egyptian mummy;
but it can crow with delight, and when the band is playing,
open and shut its animated mittens in perfect time to the music.</p>

<p>Grandfather, with his pipe and spectacles and fur cap, makes
quite a picture as he holds Baby upon his knee. Perched high
upon their canopied platforms, the party can see all that is going
on. No wonder the ladies look complacently at the glassy ice;
with a stove for a footstool, one might sit cosily beside the North
Pole.</p>

<p>There is a gentleman with them, who somewhat resembles
St. Nicholas as he appeared to the young Van Glecks on the
fifth of December. But the Saint had a flowing white beard, and
this face is as smooth as a pippin. His Saintship was larger
round the body too, and (between ourselves) he had a pair of
thimbles in his mouth, which this gentleman certainly has not.
It cannot be St. Nicholas, after all.</p>

<p>Near by in the next pavilion sit the Van Holps, with their son
and daughter (the Van Gends) from The Hague. Peter's sister
is not one to forget her promises. She has brought bouquets
of exquisite hot-house flowers for the winners.</p>

<p>These pavilions,&mdash;and there are others beside,&mdash;have all been erected
since daylight. That semicircular one, containing Mynheer Korbes's
family, is very pretty, and proves that the Hollanders are quite
skilled at tentmaking; but I like the Van Glecks' best,&mdash;the centre
one, striped red and white, and hung with evergreens.</p>

<p>The one with the blue flags contains the musicians. Those
pagoda-like affairs, decked with sea-shells and streamers of every
possible hue, are the judges' stands; and those columns and flagstaffs
upon the ice mark the limit of the race-course. The two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4762" id="Page_4762">[Pg 4762]</a></span>
white columns twined with green, connected at the top by that
long floating strip of drapery, form the starting point. Those
flagstaffs, half a mile off, stand at each end of the boundary line,
cut sufficiently deep to be distinct to the skaters, though not
deep enough to trip them when they turn to come back to the
starting-point.</p>

<p>The air is so clear, it seems scarcely possible that the columns and
flagstaffs are so far apart. Of course the judges' stands are but
little nearer together. Half a mile on the ice, when the atmosphere is
like this, is but a short distance after all, especially when fenced
with a living chain of spectators.</p>

<p>The music has commenced. How melody seems to enjoy itself in the open
air! The fiddles have forgotten their agony, and everything is
harmonious. Until you look at the blue tent, it seems that the music
springs from the sunshine, it is so boundless, so joyous. Only the
musicians are solemn.</p>

<p>Where are the racers? All assembled together near the white
columns. It is a beautiful sight,&mdash;forty boys and girls in picturesque
attire, darting with electric swiftness in and out among
each other, or sailing in pairs and triplets, beckoning, chatting,
whispering, in the fullness of youthful glee.</p>

<p>A few careful ones are soberly tightening their straps; others,
halting on one leg, with flushed eager faces, suddenly cross
the suspected skate over their knee, give it an examining shake,
and dart off again. One and all are possessed with the spirit
of motion. They cannot stand still. Their skates are a part of
them, and every runner seems bewitched.</p>

<p>Holland is the place for skaters, after all. Where else can
nearly every boy and girl perform feats on the ice that would
attract a crowd if seen on Central Park? Look at Ben! I did
not see him before. He is really astonishing the natives; no
easy thing to do in the Netherlands. Save your strength, Ben;
you will need it soon. Now other boys are trying! Ben is surpassed
already. Such jumping, such poising, such spinning, such
india-rubber exploits generally! That boy with a red cap is the
lion now; his back is a watch-spring, his body is cork&mdash;no, it is
iron, or it would snap at that. He is a bird, a top, a rabbit, a
corkscrew, a sprite, a flesh-ball, all in an instant. When you
think he is erect, he is down; and when you think he is down,
he is up. He drops his glove on the ice, and turns a somerset
as he picks it up. Without stopping, he snatches the cap from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4763" id="Page_4763">[Pg 4763]</a></span>
Jacob Poot's astonished head, and claps it back again "hind side
before." Lookers-on hurrah and laugh. Foolish boy! It is
arctic weather under your feet, but more than temperate overhead.
Big drops already are rolling down your forehead. Superb
skater as you are, you may lose the race.</p>

<p>A French traveler, standing with a notebook in his hand, sees
our English friend Ben buy a doughnut of the dwarf's brother,
and eat it. Thereupon he writes in his note-book that the Dutch
take enormous mouthfuls, and universally are fond of potatoes
boiled in molasses.</p>

<p>There are some familiar faces near the white columns. Lambert,
Ludwig, Peter, and Carl are all there, cool, and in good
skating order. Hans is not far off. Evidently he is going to
join in the race, for his skates are on,&mdash;the very pair that he
sold for seven guilders. He had soon suspected that his fairy
godmother was the mysterious "friend" who bought them. This
settled, he had boldly charged her with the deed; and she,
knowing well that all her little savings had been spent in the
purchase, had not had the face to deny it. Through the fairy
god-mother, too, he had been rendered amply able to buy them
back again. Therefore Hans is to be in the race. Carl is more
indignant than ever about it; but as three other peasant boys
have entered, Hans is not alone.</p>

<p>Twenty boys and twenty girls. The latter by this time are
standing in front, braced for the start; for they are to have the
first "run." Hilda, Rychie, and Katrinka are among them. Two
or three bend hastily to give a last pull at their skate-straps. It
is pretty to see them stamp, to be sure that all is firm. Hilda
is speaking pleasantly to a graceful little creature in a red jacket
and a new brown petticoat. Why, it is Gretel! What a difference
those pretty shoes make; and the skirt and the new cap!
Annie Bouman is there too. Even Janzoon Kolp's sister has been
admitted; but Janzoon himself has been voted out by the directors
because he killed the stork, and only last summer was caught
in the act of robbing a bird's nest,&mdash;a legal offense in Holland.</p>

<p>This Janzoon Kolp, you see, was&mdash;There, I cannot tell the story just
now. The race is about to commence.</p>

<p>Twenty girls are formed in a line. The music has ceased.</p>

<p>A man whom we shall call the crier stands between the columns and the
first judges' stand. He reads the rules in a loud voice:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4764" id="Page_4764">[Pg 4764]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>The girls and boys are to race in turn, until one girl and
one boy have beaten twice. They are to start in a line from the
united columns, skate to the flagstaff line, turn, and then come
back to the starting-point; thus making a mile at each run.</i>"</p></div>

<p>A flag is waved from the judges' stand. Madame Van Gleck rises in her
pavilion. She leans forward with a white handkerchief in her hand.
When she drops it, a bugler is to give the signal for them to start.</p>

<p>The handkerchief is fluttering to the ground. Hark!</p>

<p>They are off!</p>

<p>No. Back again. Their line was not true in passing the judges' stand.</p>

<p>The signal is repeated.</p>

<p>Off again. No mistake this time. Whew! how fast they go!</p>

<p>The multitude is quiet for an instant, absorbed in eager,
breathless watching.</p>

<p>Cheers spring up along the line of spectators. Huzza! five
girls are ahead. Who comes flying back from the boundary
mark? We cannot tell. Something red, that is all. There is a
blue spot flitting near it, and a dash of yellow nearer still.
Spectators at this end of the line strain their eyes, and wish
they had taken their post nearer the flagstaff.</p>

<p>The wave of cheers is coming back again. Now we can see.
Katrinka is ahead!</p>

<p>She passes the Van Holp pavilion. The next is Madame Van
Gleck's. That leaning figure gazing from it is a magnet. Hilda
shoots past Katrinka, waving her hand to her mother as she
passes. Two others are close now, whizzing on like arrows.
What is that flash of red and gray? Hurrah, it is Gretel! She
too waves her hand, but toward no gay pavilion. The crowd is
cheering; but she hears only her father's voice, "Well done,
little Gretel!" Soon Katrinka, with a quick merry laugh, shoots
past Hilda. The girl in yellow is gaining now. She passes
them all,&mdash;all except Gretel. The judges lean forward without
seeming to lift their eyes from their watches. Cheer after cheer
fills the air; the very columns seem rocking. Gretel has passed
them. She has won.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gretel Brinker, one mile!</span>" shouts the crier.</p>

<p>The judges nod. They write something upon a tablet which
each holds in his hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4765" id="Page_4765">[Pg 4765]</a></span>
While the girls are resting,&mdash;some crowding eagerly around
our frightened little Gretel, some standing aside in high disdain,&mdash;the
boys form in a line.</p>

<p>Mynheer Van Gleck drops the handkerchief this time. The
buglers give a vigorous blast. Off start the boys!</p>

<p>Half-way already. Did ever you see the like!</p>

<p>Three hundred legs flashing by in an instant. But there are
only twenty boys. No matter; there were hundreds of legs, I
am sure. Where are they now? There is such a noise one gets
bewildered. What are the people laughing at? Oh! at that fat
boy in the rear. See him go! See him! He'll be down in an
instant; no, he won't. I wonder if he knows he is all alone: the
other boys are nearly at the boundary line. Yes, he knows it.
He stops. He wipes his hot face. He takes off his cap, and
looks about him. Better to give up with a good grace. He has
made a hundred friends by that hearty, astonished laugh. Good
Jacob Poot!</p>

<p>The fine fellow is already among the spectators, gazing as
eagerly as the rest.</p>

<p>A cloud of feathery ice flies from the heels of the skaters as
they "bring to," and turn at the flagstaffs.</p>

<p>Something black is coming now,&mdash;one of the boys: it is all we
know. He has touched the <i>vox humana</i> stop of the crowd; it
fairly roars. Now they come nearer; we can see the red cap.
There's Ben, there's Peter, there's Hans!</p>

<p>Hans is ahead. Young Madame Van Gend almost crushes
the flowers in her hand: she had been quite sure that Peter
would be first. Carl Schummel is next, then Ben, and the youth
with the red cap. The others are pressing close. A tall figure
darts from among them. He passes the red cap, he passes Ben,
then Carl. Now it is an even race between him and Hans.
Madame Van Gend catches her breath.</p>

<p>It is Peter! He is ahead! Hans shoots past him. Hilda's
eyes fill with tears: Peter <i>must</i> beat. Annie's eyes flash proudly.
Gretel gazes with clasped hands: four strokes more will take her
brother to the columns.</p>

<p>He is there! Yes; but so was young Schummel just a second
before. At the last instant, Carl, gathering his powers, had
whizzed between them, and passed the goal.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Carl Schummel, one mile!</span>" shouts the crier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4766" id="Page_4766">[Pg 4766]</a></span>
Soon Madame Van Gleck rises again. The falling handkerchief
starts the bugle, and the bugle, using its voice as a bowstring,
shoots off twenty girls like so many arrows.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful sight; but one has not long to look: before
we can fairly distinguish them they are far in the distance.
This time they are close upon one another. It is hard to say,
as they come speeding back from the flagstaff, which will reach
the columns first. There are new faces among the foremost,&mdash;eager
glowing faces, unnoticed before. Katrinka is there, and
Hilda; but Gretel and Rychie are in the rear. Gretel is wavering,
but when Rychie passes her she starts forward afresh. Now
they are nearly beside Katrinka. Hilda is still in advance: she
is almost "home." She has not faltered since that bugle note
sent her flying: like an arrow, still she is speeding toward the
goal. Cheer after cheer rises in the air. Peter is silent, but
his eyes shine like stars. "Huzza! Huzza!"</p>

<p>The crier's voice is heard again.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hilda van Gleck, one mile!</span>"</p>

<p>A loud murmur of approval runs through the crowd, catching
the music in its course, till all seems one sound, with a glad
rhythmic throbbing in its depths. When the flag waves all is
still.</p>

<p>Once more the bugle blows a terrific blast. It sends off the
boys like chaff before the wind,&mdash;dark chaff, I admit, and in big
pieces.</p>

<p>It is whisked around at the flagstaff, driven faster yet by the
cheers and shouts along the line. We begin to see what is coming.
There are three boys in advance this time, and all abreast,&mdash;Hans,
Peter, and Lambert. Carl soon breaks the ranks, rushing
through with a whiff. Fly, Hans; fly, Peter; don't let Carl
beat again!&mdash;Carl the bitter, Carl the insolent. Van Mounen is
flagging, but you are as strong as ever. Hans and Peter, Peter
and Hans; which is foremost? We love them both. We scarcely
care which is the fleeter.</p>

<p>Hilda, Annie, and Gretel, seated upon the long crimson bench, can
remain quiet no longer. They spring to their feet, so different! and
yet one in eagerness. Hilda instantly reseats herself: none shall know
how interested she is; none shall know how anxious, how filled with
one hope. Shut your eyes then, Hilda, hide your face rippling with
joy. Peter has beaten.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4767" id="Page_4767">[Pg 4767]</a></span>
"<span class="smcap">Peter van Holp, one mile!</span>" calls the crier.</p>

<p>The same buzz of excitement as before, while the judges take notes,
the same throbbing of music through the din; but something is
different. A little crowd presses close about some object near the
column. Carl has fallen. He is not hurt, though somewhat stunned. If
he were less sullen, he would find more sympathy in these warm young
hearts. As it is, they forget him as soon as he is fairly on his feet
again.</p>

<p>The girls are to skate their third mile.</p>

<p>How resolute the little maidens look, as they stand in a line!
Some are solemn with a sense of responsibility; some wear a
smile, half bashful, half provoked; but one air of determination
pervades them all.</p>

<p>This third mile may decide the race. Still, if neither Gretel
nor Hilda win, there is yet a chance among the rest for the
silver skates.</p>

<p>Each girl feels sure that this time she will accomplish the
distance in one-half the time. How they stamp to try their
runners! How nervously they examine each strap! How erect
they stand at last, every eye upon Madame Van Gleck!</p>

<p>The bugle thrills through them again. With quivering eagerness
they spring forward, bending, but in perfect balance. Each
flashing stroke seems longer than the last.</p>

<p>Now they are skimming off in the distance.</p>

<p>Again the eager straining of eyes; again the shouts and
cheering; again the thrill of excitement, as after a few moments,
four or five in advance of the rest come speeding back, nearer,
nearer to the white columns.</p>

<p>Who is first? Not Rychie, Katrinka, Annie, nor Hilda, nor
the girl in yellow, but Gretel,&mdash;Gretel, the fleetest sprite of a
girl that ever skated. She was but playing in the earlier race:
<i>now</i> she is in earnest, or rather, something within her has determined
to win. That blithe little form makes no effort; but it
cannot stop,&mdash;not until the goal is passed!</p>

<p>In vain the crier lifts his voice: he cannot be heard. He has
no news to tell: it is already ringing through the crowd,&mdash;<i>Gretel
has won the silver skates!</i></p>

<p>Like a bird she has flown over the ice; like a bird she looks
about her in a timid, startled way. She longs to dart to the
sheltered nook where her father and mother stand. But Hans is
beside her; the girls are crowding round. Hilda's kind, joyous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4768" id="Page_4768">[Pg 4768]</a></span>
voice breathes in her ear. From that hour none will despise her.
Goose-girl or not, Gretel stands acknowledged Queen of the
Skaters.</p>

<p>With natural pride, Hans turns to see if Peter Van Holp is
witnessing his sister's triumph. Peter is not looking toward
them at all. He is kneeling, bending his troubled face low, and
working hastily at his skate-strap. Hans is beside him at once.</p>

<p>"Are you in trouble, mynheer?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Hans! that you? Yes; my fun is over. I tried to
tighten my strap to make a new hole, and this botheration of a
knife has cut it nearly in two."</p>

<p>"Mynheer," said Hans, at the same time pulling off a skate,
"you must use my strap!"</p>

<p>"Not I, indeed, Hans Brinker!" cried Peter, looking up;
"though I thank you warmly. Go to your post, my friend: the
bugle will sound in a minute."</p>

<p>"Mynheer," pleaded Hans in a husky voice, "you have called
me your friend. Take this strap&mdash;quick! There is not an
instant to lose. I shall not skate this time: indeed, I am out of
practice. Mynheer, you <i>must</i> take it;" and Hans, blind and
deaf to any remonstrance, slipped his strap into Peter's skate,
and implored him to put it on.</p>

<p>"Come, Peter!" cried Lambert from the line: "we are waiting
for you."</p>

<p>"For Madame's sake," pleaded Hans, "be quick! She is
motioning to you to join the racers. There, the skate is almost
on: quick, mynheer, fasten it. I could not possibly win. The
race lies between Master Schummel and yourself."</p>

<p>"You are a noble fellow, Hans!" cried Peter, yielding at
last. He sprang to his post just as the handkerchief fell to
the ground. The bugle sends forth its blast, loud, clear, and
ringing.</p>

<p>Off go the boys!</p>

<p>"Mein Gott!" cries a tough old fellow from Delft. "They
beat everything, these Amsterdam youngsters. See them!"</p>

<p>See them, indeed! They are winged Mercuries, every one of
them. What mad errand are they on? Ah, I know; they are
hunting Peter Van Holp. He is some fleet-footed runaway from
Olympus. Mercury and his troop of winged cousins are in full
chase. They will catch him! Now Carl is the runaway. The
pursuit grows furious. Ben is foremost!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4769" id="Page_4769">[Pg 4769]</a></span>
The chase turns in a cloud of mist. It is coming this way.
Who is hunted now? Mercury himself. It is Peter, Peter Van
Holp! Fly, Peter! Hans is watching you. He is sending all
his fleetness, all his strength, into your feet. Your mother and
sister are pale with eagerness. Hilda is trembling, and dare not
look up, Fly, Peter! The crowd has not gone deranged; it is
only cheering. The pursuers are close upon you. Touch the
white column! It beckons; it is reeling before you&mdash;it&mdash;</p>

<p>"Huzza! Huzza! Peter has won the silver skates!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Peter van Holp!</span>" shouted the crier. But who heard him?
"Peter Van Holp!" shouted a hundred voices; for he was the
favorite boy of the place. "Huzza! Huzza!"</p>

<p>Now the music was resolved to be heard. It struck up a
lively air, then a tremendous march. The spectators, thinking
something new was about to happen, deigned to listen and to
look.</p>

<p>The racers formed in single file. Peter, being tallest, stood
first. Gretel, the smallest of all, took her place at the end.
Hans, who had borrowed a strap from the cake-boy, was near
the head.</p>

<p>Three gayly twined arches were placed at intervals upon the
river, facing the Van Gleck pavilion.</p>

<p>Skating slowly, and in perfect time to the music, the boys
and girls moved forward, led on by Peter, It was beautiful to
see the bright procession glide along like a living creature. It
curved and doubled, and drew its graceful length in and out
among the arches; whichever way Peter, the head, went, the
body was sure to follow. Sometimes it steered direct for the
centre arch; then, as if seized with a new impulse, turned away
and curled itself about the first one; then unwound slowly, and
bending low, with quick snake-like curvings, crossed the river,
passing at length through the farthest arch.</p>

<p>When the music was slow, the procession seemed to crawl
like a thing afraid; it grew livelier, and the creature darted forward
with a spring, gliding rapidly among the arches, in and
out, curling, twisting, turning, never losing form, until at the
shrill call of the bugle rising above the music it suddenly
resolved itself into boys and girls, standing in double semicircle
before Madame Van Gleck's pavilion.</p>

<p>Peter and Gretel stand in the centre, in advance of the others.
Madame Van Gleck rises majestically. Gretel trembles, but feels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4770" id="Page_4770">[Pg 4770]</a></span>
that she must look at the beautiful lady. She cannot hear what
is said, there is such a buzzing all around her. She is thinking
that she ought to try and make a courtesy, such as her mother
makes to the <i>meester</i>, when suddenly something so dazzling is
placed in her hand that she gives a cry of joy.</p>

<p>Then she ventures to look about her. Peter too has something in his
hands. "Oh, oh! how splendid!" she cries; and "Oh! how splendid!" is
echoed as far as people can see.</p>

<p>Meantime the silver skates flash in the sunshine, throwing dashes of
light upon those two happy faces.</p>

<p>"Mevrouw Van Gend sends a little messenger with her bouquets,&mdash;one for
Hilda, one for Carl, and others for Peter and Gretel."</p>

<p>At sight of the flowers, the Queen of the Skaters becomes
uncontrollable. With a bright stare of gratitude, she gathers skates
and bouquet in her apron, hugs them to her bosom, and darts off to
search for her father and mother in the scattering crowd.</p>

<h4>(1573-1631)</h4>

</div><p class="dropcap">he memory of Dr. Donne must not, cannot die, as long as men speak
English," wrote Izaak Walton, "whilst his conversation made him and
others happy. His life ought to be the example of more than that age
in which he died."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/Illus107.png" width="180" height="220" alt="John Donne" title="John Donne" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">John Donne</span></span>
</div>

<p>Born in 1573, all the influences of the age in which Donne lived
nourished his large nature and genius. Shakespeare and Marlowe were
nine years older than he; Chapman fourteen; Spenser, Lyly, and Richard
Hooker each twenty; while Sir Philip Sidney counted one year less.
Lodge and Puttenham were grown men, and Greene and Nash riotous boys.
In the following year Ben Jonson "came forth to warm our ears," and
soon after we have his future co-worker Inigo Jones. It was the time
of a multitude of poets,&mdash;Drayton, the Fletchers, Beaumont, Wither,
Herrick, Carew, Suckling, and others. Imagination was foremost, and
was stimulated by vast discoveries. Debates upon ecclesiastical
reform, led by Wyclif, Tyndal, Knox, Foxe, Sternhold, Hopkins, and
others, had prepared the way; and the luminous literatures of Greece
and Italy, but recently brought into England, had made men's spirits
receptive and creative. It was a period of vast conceptions, when men
discovered themselves and the world afresh.</p>

<p>Under such outward conditions Donne was born, in London, "of
good and virtuous parents," says Walton, being descended on his
mother's side from no less distinguished a personage than Sir Thomas
More. In 1584, when he was eleven years old, with a good command
both of French and Latin, he passed from the hands of tutors at
home to Hare Hall, a much frequented college at Oxford. Here he
formed a friendship with Henry Wotton, who, after the poet's death,
collected the material from which Walton wrote his tender and sincere
'Life of Donne.'</p>

<p>After leaving Oxford he traveled for three years on the Continent,
and on his return in 1592 became a member of Lincoln's Inn, with
intent to study law; but his law never, says Walton, "served him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4772" id="Page_4772">[Pg 4772]</a></span>
for other use than an ornament and self-satisfaction." While a member
of Lincoln's Inn he became one of the coterie of the poets of his
youth. To this time are to be referred those of his 'Divine Poems'
which show him a sincere Catholic. Stirred by the increasing differences
between the Romanist and the Anglican denominations, Donne
turned toward theological questions, and finally cast his lot with the
new doctrines.  His large nature, impetuously reacting from the
asceticism to which he had been bred, turned to excess and overboldness
in action, and an occasional coarseness of phrasing in his poems.</p>

<p>The first of his famous 'Satires' are dated 1593, and all were probably
written before 1601. During this time also he squandered his
father's legacy of &pound;3000. In 1596, when the Earl of Essex defeated the
Spanish navy and pillaged Cadiz, Donne, now one of the first poets
of the time, was among his followers. "Not long after his return
into England ... the Lord Ellesmere, the Keeper of the Great
Seal,... taking notice of his learning, languages, and other
abilities, and much affecting his person and behavior, took him to be
his chief secretary, supposing and intending it to be an introduction to
some weighty employment in the State;... and did always use
him with much courtesy, appointing him a place at his own table."
Here he met the niece of Lady Ellesmere,&mdash;the daughter of Sir
George More, Lord Lieutenant of the Tower,&mdash;whom at Christmas,
1600, he married, despite the opposition of her father. Sir George,
transported with wrath, obtained Donne's imprisonment; but the poet
finally regained his liberty and his wife, Sir George in the end forgiving
the young couple. "Mr. Donne's estate was the greatest part
spent in many chargeable travels, books, and dear-bought experience,
he [being] out of all employment that might yield a support for himself
and wife." The depth and intensity of Donne's feeling for this
beautiful and accomplished woman are manifested, says Mr. Norton,
in all the poems known to be addressed to her, such as 'The Anniversary'
and 'The Token.'</p>

<p>Of 'The Valediction Forbidding Mourning' Walton declares:&mdash;"I
beg leave to tell that I have heard some critics, learned both in languages
and poetry, say that none of the Greek or Latin poets did
ever equal them;" while from Lowell's unpublished 'Lecture on
Poetic Diction' Professor Norton quotes the opinion that "This poem
is a truly sacred one, and fuller of the soul of poetry than a whole
Alexandrian Library of common love verses."</p>

<p>During this period of writing for court favors, Donne wrote many
of his sonnets and studied the civil and canon law. After the death
of his patron Sir Francis in 1606, Donne divided his time between
Mitcham, whither he had removed his family, and London, where he
frequented distinguished and fashionable drawing-rooms. At this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4773" id="Page_4773">[Pg 4773]</a></span>
time he wrote his admirable epistles in verse, 'The Litany,' and
funeral elegies on Lady Markham and Mistress Bulstrode; but those
poems are merely "occasional," as he was not a poet by profession.
At the request of King James he wrote the 'Pseudo-Martyr,' published
in 1610. In 1611 appeared his funeral elegy 'An Anatomy of
the World,' and one year later another of like texture, 'On the Progress
of the Soul,' both poems being exalted and elaborate in thought
and fancy.</p>

<p>The King, desiring Donne to enter into the ministry, denied all
requests for secular preferment, and the unwilling poet deferred his
decision for almost three years. All that time he studied textual
divinity, Greek, and Hebrew. He was ordained about the beginning
of 1615. The King made him his chaplain in ordinary, and promised
other preferments. "Now," says Walton, "the English Church had
gained a second St. Austin, for I think none was so like him before
his conversion, none so like St. Ambrose after it; and if his youth
had the infirmities of the one, his age had the excellences of the
other, the learning and holiness of both."</p>

<p>In 1621 the King made him Dean of St. Paul's, and vicar of St.
Dunstan in the West. By these and other ecclesiastical emoluments
"he was enabled to become charitable to the poor and kind to his
friends, and to make such provision for his children that they were
not left scandalous, as relating to their or his profession or quality."</p>

<p>His first printed sermons appeared in 1622. The epigrammatic
terseness and unexpected turns of imagination which characterize the
poems, are found also in his discourses. Three years later, during a
dangerous illness, he composed his 'Devotion.' He died on the 31st
of March, 1631.</p>

<p>"Donne is full of salient verses," says Lowell in his 'Shakespeare
Once More,' "that would take the rudest March winds of criticism
with their beauty; of thoughts that first tease us like charades, and
then delight us with the felicity of their solution." There are few in
which an occasional loftiness is sustained throughout, but this occasional
excellence is original, condensed, witty, showing a firm and
strong mind, clear to a degree almost un-English. His poetry has
somewhat of the stability of the Greeks, though it may lack their
sweetness and art. His grossness was the heritage of his time. He
is classed among the "metaphysical poets," of whom Dr. Johnson
wrote:&mdash;"They were of very little care to clothe their notions with
elegance of dress, and therefore miss the notice and the praise which
are often gained by those who think less, but are more diligent to
adorn their thoughts." It was in obedience to such a dictum, and to
Dryden's suggestion, doubtless, that Pope and Parnell recast and
re-versified the 'Satires.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4774" id="Page_4774">[Pg 4774]</a></span>
The first edition of Donne's poems appeared two years after his death.
Several editions succeeded during the seventeenth century. In the more
artificial eighteenth century his harsh and abrupt versification and
remote theorems made him difficult to understand. The best editions
are 'The Complete Poems of John Donne,' edited by Dr. Alexander
Grosart (1872); and 'The Poems of John Donne,' from the text of the
edition of 1633, edited by Charles Eliot Norton (1895), from whose
work the citations in this volume are taken.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">n certain respects Dosto&eacute;vsky is the most characteristically national
of Russian writers. Precisely for that reason, his work does not
appeal to so wide a circle outside of his own country as does the work
of Turg&eacute;nieff and Count L.N. Tolstoy. This result flows not only from
the natural bent of his mind and temperament, but also from the
peculiar vicissitudes of his life as compared with the comparatively
even tenor of their existence, and the circumstances of the time in
which he lived. These circumstances, it is true, were felt by the
writers mentioned; but practically they affected him far more deeply
than they did the others, with their rather one-sided training; and
his fellow-countrymen&mdash;especially the young of both sexes&mdash;were not
slow to express their appreciation of the fact. His special domain was
the one which Turg&eacute;nieff and Tolstoy did not understand, and have
touched not at all, or only incidentally,&mdash;the great middle class of
society, or what corresponds thereto in Russia.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Feodor Dosto&eacute;vsky</span></span>
</div>

<p>Through his father, Mikhail Andr&eacute;evitch Dosto&eacute;vsky,
Feodor Mikhailovitch belonged to the class of "nobles,"&mdash;that is
to say, to the gentry; through his mother, to the respectable,
well-to-do merchant class, which is still distinct from the other, and
was even more so during the first half of the present century; and in
personal appearance he was a typical member of the peasant class. The
father was resident physician in the Marie Hospital for the Poor in
Moscow, having entered the civil service at the end of the war of
1812, during which he had served as a physician in the army. In the
very contracted apartment which he occupied in the hospital, Feodor
was born&mdash;one of a family of seven children, all of whom, with
the exception of the eldest and the youngest, were born there&mdash;on
October 30th (November 11th), 1821. The parents were very upright,
well-educated, devoutly religious people; and as Feodor expressed
it many years later to his elder brother, after their father
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4780" id="Page_4780">[Pg 4780]</a></span>
died, "Do you know, our parents were very superior people, and they
would have been superior even in these days." The children were
brought up at home as long as possible, and received their instruction
from tutors and their father. Even after the necessity of preparing
the two elder boys for a government institution forced the parents to
send them to a boarding-school during the week, they continued their
strict supervision over their associates, discouraged nearly all
friendships with their comrades, and never allowed them to go into the
street unaccompanied, after the national custom in good families, even
at the age of seventeen or more.</p>

<p>Feodor, according to the account of his brothers and relatives,
was always a quiet, studious lad, and he with his elder brother
Mikhail spent their weekly holidays chiefly in reading, Walter Scott
and James Fenimore Cooper being among their favorite authors;
though Russian writers, especially Pushkin, were not neglected. During
many of these years the mother and children passed the summers
on a little estate in the country which the father bought, and
it was there that Feodor Mikhailovitch first made acquaintance with
the beauties of nature, to which he eloquently refers in after life,
and especially with the peasants, their feelings and temper, which
greatly helped him in his psychological studies and in his ability to
endure certain trials which came upon him. There can be no doubt
that his whole training contributed not only to the literary tastes
which the famous author and his brother cherished throughout their
lives, but to the formation of that friendship between them which
was stronger than all others, and to the sincere belief in religion and
the profound piety which permeated the spirit and the books of
Feodor Mikhailovitch.</p>

<p>In 1837 the mother died, and the father took his two eldest sons to
St. Petersburg to enter them in the government School of Engineers.
But the healthy Mikhail was pronounced consumptive by the doctor,
while the sickly Feodor was given a certificate of perfect health.
Consequently Mikhail was rejected, and went to the Engineers' School
in Revel, while Feodor, always quiet and reserved, was left lonely in
the St. Petersburg school. Here he remained for three years, studying
well, but devoting a great deal of time to his passionately beloved
literary subjects, and developing a precocious and penetrating
critical judgment on such matters. It is even affirmed that he began
or wrote the first draft of his famous book 'Poor People,' by night,
during this period; though in another account he places its
composition later. After graduating well as ensign in 1841, he studied
for another year, and became an officer with the rank of
sub-lieutenant, and entered on active service, attached to the
draughting department of the Engineers' School, in August 1843.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4781" id="Page_4781">[Pg 4781]</a></span>
A little more than a year later he resigned from the service, in order
that he might devote himself wholly to literature. His father had died
in the mean time, and had he possessed any practical talent he might
have lived in comfort on the sums which his guardian sent him. But
throughout his life people seemed to fleece him at will; he lost large
sums at billiards with strangers, and otherwise; he was generous and
careless; in short, he was to the end nearly always in debt, anxiety,
and difficulties. Then came the first important crisis in his life. He
wrote (or re-wrote) 'Poor People'; and said of his state of mind, as
he reckoned up the possible pecuniary results, that he could not sleep
for nights together, and "If my undertaking does not succeed, perhaps
I shall hang myself." The history of that success is famous and
stirring. His only acquaintance in literary circles was his old
comrade D.V. Grigorovitch (also well known as a writer), and to him he
committed the manuscript. His friend took it to the poet and editor
Nekr&aacute;soff, in the hope that it might appear in the 'Collection' which
the latter was intending to publish. Dosto&eacute;vsky was especially afraid
of the noted critic Byelinsky's judgment on it: "He will laugh at my
'Poor People,'" said he; "but I wrote it with passion, almost with
tears."</p>

<p>He spent the evening with a friend, reading with him, as was the
fashion of the time, Gogol's 'Dead Souls,' and returned home at four
o'clock in the morning. It was one of the "white nights" of early
summer, and he sat down by his window. Suddenly the door-bell rang,
and in rushed Grigorovitch and Nekr&aacute;soff, who flung themselves upon
his neck. They had begun to read his story in the evening, remarking
that "ten pages would suffice to show its quality." But they had gone
on reading, relieving each other as their voices failed them with
fatigue and emotion, until the whole was finished. At the point where
Pokrovsky's old father runs after his coffin, Nekr&aacute;soff pounded the
table with the manuscript, deeply affected, and exclaimed, "Deuce take
him!" Then they decide to hasten to Dosto&eacute;vsky: "No matter if he is
asleep&mdash;we will wake him up. <i>This</i> is above sleep."</p>

<p>This sort of glory and success was exactly of that pure, unmixed
sort which Dosto&eacute;vsky had longed for. When Nekr&aacute;soff went to
Byelinsky with the manuscript of 'Poor People,' and announced, "A
new Gogol has made his appearance!" the critic retorted with severity,
"Gogols spring up like mushrooms among us." But when he
had read the story he said, "Bring him hither, bring him quickly;"
and welcomed Dosto&eacute;vsky when he came, with extreme dignity and
reserve, but exclaimed in a moment, "Do you understand yourself
what sort of a thing this is that you have written?" From that
moment the young author's fame was assured, and he became known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4782" id="Page_4782">[Pg 4782]</a></span>
and popular even in advance of publication in a wide circle of literary
and other people, as was the fashion of those days in Russia.
When the story appeared, the public rapturously echoed the judgment
of the critics.</p>

<p>The close friendship which sprang up between Byelinsky and Dosto&eacute;vsky
was destined, however, to exert an extraordinary influence
upon Dosto&eacute;vsky's career, quite apart from its critical aspect. Byelinsky
was an atheist and a socialist, and Dosto&eacute;vsky was brought
into relations with persons who shared those views, although he himself
never wavered, apparently, in his religious faith, and was never
in harmony with any other aspirations of his associates except that
of freeing the serfs. Notwithstanding this, he became involved in the
catastrophe which overtook many visitors, occasional or constant, of
the "circles" at whose head stood Petrashevsky. The whole affair is
known as the Conspiracy of Petrashevsky.  During the '40's the
students at the St. Petersburg University formed small gatherings
where sociological subjects were the objects of study, and read the
works of Stein, Haxthausen, Louis Blanc, Fourier, Proudhon, and
other similar writers. Gradually assemblies of this sort were formed
outside of the University. Petrashevsky, an employee of the Department
of Foreign Affairs, who had graduated from the Lyceum and
the University, and who was ambitious of winning power and a reputation
for eccentricity, learned of these little clubs and encouraged
their growth. He did not however encourage their close association
among themselves, but rather, entire dependence on himself, as the
centre of authority, the guide; and urged them to inaugurate a sort of
propaganda.  Dosto&eacute;vsky himself declared, about thirty years later,
that "the socialists sprang from the followers of Petrashevsky; they
sowed much seed." He has dealt with them and their methods in
his novel 'Demons'; though perhaps not with exact accuracy. But
they helped him to an elucidation of the contemporary situation,
which Turg&eacute;nieff had treated in 'Virgin Soil.' The chief subject
of their political discussions was the emancipation of the serfs, and
many of Petrashevsky's followers reckoned upon a rising of the serfs
themselves, though it was proved that Dosto&eacute;vsky maintained the
propriety and necessity of the reform proceeding from the government.
This was no new topic; the Emperor Nicholas I. had already
begun to plan the Emancipation, and it is probable that it would
have taken place long before it did, had it not been for this very
conspiracy. From the point of view of the government, the movement
was naturally dangerous, especially in view of what was taking
place in Europe at that epoch. Dosto&eacute;vsky bore himself critically
toward the socialistic writings and doctrines, maintaining that in
their own Russian system of workingmen's guilds with reciprocal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4783" id="Page_4783">[Pg 4783]</a></span>
bonds there existed surer and more normal foundations than in all
the dreams of Saint-Simon and all his school. He did not even visit
very frequently the circle to which he particularly belonged, and was
rarely at the house of Petrashevsky, whom many personally disliked.</p>

<p>But on one occasion, as he was a good reader, he was asked to
read aloud Byelinsky's famous letter to Gogol, which was regarded
as a victorious manifest of "Western" (<i>i. e.</i>, of socialistic) views.
This, technically, was propagating revolution, and was the chief
charge against him when the catastrophe happened, and he, together
with over thirty other "Petrashevtzi," was arrested on April 23d
(May 5th), 1849. In the Peter-Paul Fortress prison, where he was
kept for eight months pending trial, Dosto&eacute;vsky wrote 'The Little
Hero,' two or three unimportant works having appeared since 'Poor
People.' At last he, with several others, was condemned to death
and led out for execution. The history of that day, and the analysis
of his sensations and emotions, are to be found in several of his
books: 'Crime and Punishment,' 'The Idiot,' 'The Karamazoff Brothers.'
At the last moment it was announced to them that the Emperor
had commuted their sentence to exile in varying degrees, and
they were taken to Siberia. Alexei Pleshtcheeff, then twenty-three
years of age, the man who sent Byelinsky's letter to Dosto&eacute;vsky, was
banished for a short term of years to the disciplinary brigade in
Orenburg; and when I saw him in St. Petersburg forty years later,
I was able to form a faint idea of what Dosto&eacute;vsky's popularity must
have been, by the way in which he,&mdash;a man of much less talent, originality,
and personal power,&mdash;was surrounded, even in church, by
adoring throngs of young people. Dosto&eacute;vsky's sentence was "four
years at forced labor in prison; after that, to serve as a common
soldier"; but he did not lose his nobility and his civil rights, being
the first noble to retain them under such circumstances.</p>

<p>The story of what he did and suffered during his imprisonment is
to be found in his 'Notes from the House of the Dead,' where,
under the disguise of a man sentenced to ten years' labor for the
murder of his wife, he gives us a startling, faithful, but in some
respects a consoling picture of life in a Siberian prison. His own
judgment as to his exile was, "The government only defended itself;"
and when people said to him, "How unjust your exile was!" he
replied, even with irritation, "No, it was just. The people themselves
would have condemned us." Moreover, he did not like to give
benefit readings in later years from his 'Notes from the House of the
Dead,' lest he might be thought to complain. Besides, this catastrophe
was the making of him, by his own confession; he had become
a confirmed hypochondriac, with a host of imaginary afflictions
and ills, and had this affair not saved him from himself he said that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4784" id="Page_4784">[Pg 4784]</a></span>
he "should have gone mad." It seems certain, from the testimony
of his friend and physician, that he was already subject to the epileptic
fits which he himself was wont to attribute to his imprisonment;
and which certainly increased in severity as the years went
on, until they occurred once a month or oftener, in consequence of
overwork and excessive nervous strain. In his novel 'The Idiot,'
whose hero is an epileptic, he has made a psychological study of his
sensations before and after such fits, and elsewhere he makes allusions
to them.</p>

<p>After serving in the ranks and being promoted officer when he
had finished his term of imprisonment, he returned to Russia in 1859,
and lived first at Tver; afterward, when permitted, in St. Petersburg.
The history of his first marriage&mdash;which took place in Siberia, to
the widow of a friend&mdash;is told with tolerable accuracy in his 'Humbled
and Insulted,' which also contains a description of his early struggles
and the composition of 'Poor People,' the hero who narrates
the tale of his love and sacrifice being himself. Like that hero, he
tried to facilitate his future wife's marriage to another man. He
was married to his second wife, by whom he had four children, in
1867, and to her he owed much happiness and material comfort. It
will be seen that much is to be learned concerning our author from
his own novels, though it would hardly be safe to write a biography
from them alone. Even in 'Crime and Punishment,' his greatest
work in a general way, he reproduces events of his own life, meditations,
wonderfully accurate descriptions of the third-rate quarter of
the town in which he lived after his return from Siberia, while engaged
on some of his numerous newspaper and magazine enterprises.</p>

<p>This journalistic turn of mind, combined in nearly equal measures
with the literary talent, produced several singular effects. It
rendered his periodical 'Diary of a Writer' the most enormously
popular publication of the day, and a success when previous ventures
had failed, though it consisted entirely of his own views on current
topics of interest, literary questions, and whatever came into his
head. On his novels it had a rather disintegrating effect. Most of
them are of great length, are full of digressions from the point, and
there is often a lack of finish about them which extends not only to
the minor characters but to the style in general. In fact, his style
is neither jewel-like in its brilliancy, as is Turg&eacute;nieff's,
nor has it the elegance, broken by carelessness, of Tolstoy's. But it
was popular, remarkably well adapted to the class of society which it
was his province to depict, and though diffuse, it is not possible to
omit any of the long psychological analyses, or dreams, or series of ratiocinations,
without injuring the web of the story and the moral, as chain armor is
spoiled by the rupture of a link. This indeed is one of the great difficulties
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4785" id="Page_4785">[Pg 4785]</a></span>
which the foreigner encounters in an attempt to study
Dosto&eacute;vsky: the translators have been daunted by his prolixity,
and have often cut his works down to a mere skeleton of the original.
Moreover, he deals with a sort of Russian society which it is hard for
non-Russians to grasp, and he has no skill whatever in presenting
aristocratic people or society, to which foreigners have become
accustomed in the works of his great contemporaries Turg&eacute;nieff
and Tolstoy; while he never, despite all his genuine admiration for
the peasants and keen sympathy with them, attempts any purely peasant
tales like Turg&eacute;nieff's 'Notes of a Sportsman' or Tolstoy's
'Tales for the People.' Naturally, this is but one reason the more why
he should be studied. His types of hero, and of feminine character,
are peculiar to himself. Perhaps the best way to arrive at his
ideal&mdash;and at his own character, <i>plus</i> a certain irritability
and tendency to suspicion of which his friends speak&mdash;is to
scrutinize the pictures of Prince Myshkin ('The Idiot'), Ivan
('Humbled and Insulted'), and Alyosha ('The Karamazoff Brothers').
Pure, delicate both physically and morally, as Dosto&eacute;vsky
himself is described by those who knew him best; devout, gentle,
intensely sympathetic, strongly masculine yet with a large admixture
of the feminine element&mdash;such are these three; such is also, in
his way, Raskolnikoff ('Crime and Punishment'). His feminine
characters are the precise counterparts of these in many respects, but
are often also quixotic even to boldness and wrong-headedness, like
Aglaya ('The Idiot'), or to shame, like Sonia ('Crime and
Punishment'), and the heroine of 'Humbled and Insulted.' But
Dosto&eacute;vsky could not sympathize with and consequently could not
draw an aristocrat; his frequently recurring type of the dissolute
petty noble or rich merchant is frequently brutal; and his unclassed
women, though possibly quite as true to life as these men, are painful
in their callousness and recklessness. His earliest work, 'Poor
People,' written in the form of letters, is worthy of all the praises
which have been bestowed upon it, simple as is the story of the
poverty-stricken clerk who is almost too humble to draw his breath,
who pleads that one must wear a coat and boots which do not show the
bare feet, during the severe Russian winter, merely because public
opinion forces one thereto; and who shares his rare pence with a
distant but equally needy relative who is in a difficult position. As
a compact, subtle psychological study, his 'Crime and Punishment'
cannot be overrated, repulsive as it is in parts. The poor student who
kills the aged usurer with intent to rob, after prolonged argument
with himself that great geniuses, like Napoleon I. and the like, are
justified in committing any crime, and that he has a right to relieve
his poverty; and who eventually surrenders himself to the authorities
and accepts his exile as moral salvation,&mdash;is one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4786" id="Page_4786">[Pg 4786]</a></span>
strongest in Russian literature, though wrong-headed and easily
swayed, like all the author's characters.</p>

<p>In June 1880 Dosto&eacute;vsky made a speech at the unveiling of
Pushkin's monument in Moscow, which completely overshadowed the
speeches of Turg&eacute;nieff and Aksakoff, and gave rise to what was
probably the most extraordinary literary ovation ever seen in Russia.
By that time he had become the object of pilgrimages, on the part
of the young especially, to a degree which no other Russian author
has ever experienced, and the recipient of confidences, both personal
and written, which pressed heavily on his time and strength. That
ovation has never been surpassed, save by the astonishing concourse
at his funeral. He died of a lesion of the brain on January 28th
(February 8th), 1881. Thousands followed his coffin for miles, but
there was no "demonstration," as that word is understood in Russia.
Nevertheless it was a demonstration in an unexpected way, since all
classes of society, even those which had not seemed closely interested
or sympathetic, now joined in the tribute of respect, which amounted
to loving enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The works which I have mentioned are the most important, though he
wrote also 'The Stripling' and numerous shorter stories. His own
characterization of his work, when reproached with its occasional lack
of continuity and finish, was that his aim was to make his point, and
the exigencies of money and time under which he labored were to blame
for the defects which, with his keen literary judgment, he perceived
quite as clearly as did his critics. If that point be borne in mind,
it will help the reader to appreciate his literary-journalistic style,
and to pardon shortcomings for the sake of the pearls of principle and
psychology which can be fished up from the profound depths of his
voluminous tomes, and of his analysis. The gospel which Dosto&eacute;vsky
consistently preached, from the beginning of his career to the end,
was love, self-sacrifice even to self-effacement. That was and is the
secret of his power, even over those who did not follow his precepts.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_POOR_PEOPLE" id="FROM_POOR_PEOPLE"></a>FROM 'POOR PEOPLE'</h3>
<h4><a name="LetterI" id="LetterI"></a><span class="smcap">Letter from Varvara Dobrosyeloff to Makar Dyevushkin</span></h4>


<p>Pokrovsky was a poor, very poor young man; his health did
not permit of his attending regularly to his studies, and so
it was only by way of custom that we called him a student.
He lived modestly, peaceably, quietly, so that we could not even
hear him from our room. He was very queer in appearance;
he walked so awkwardly, bowed so uncouthly, spoke in such a
peculiar manner, that at first I could not look at him without
laughing. Moreover, he was of an irritable character, was constantly
getting angry, flew into a rage at the slightest trifle,
shouted at us, complained of us, and often went off to his own
room in a fit of wrath without finishing our lesson. He had a
great many books, all of them expensive, rare books. He gave
lessons somewhere else also, received some remuneration, and
just as soon as he had a little money, he went off and bought
more books.</p>

<p>In time I learned to understand him better. He was the
kindest, the most worthy man, the best man I ever met. My
mother respected him highly. Later on, he became my best
friend&mdash;after my mother, of course....</p>

<p>From time to time a little old man made his appearance at
our house&mdash;a dirty, badly dressed, small, gray-haired, sluggish,
awkward old fellow; in short, he was peculiar to the last degree.
At first sight one would have thought that he felt ashamed of
something, that his conscience smote him for something. He
writhed and twisted constantly; he had such tricks of manner
and ways of shrugging his shoulders, that one would not have
been far wrong in assuming that he was a little crazy. He
would come and stand close to the glazed door in the vestibule,
and not dare to enter. As soon as one of us, Sasha or I or one
of the servants whom he knew to be kindly disposed toward
him, passed that way, he would begin to wave his hands, and
beckon us to him, and make signs; and only when we nodded to
him or called to him,&mdash;the signal agreed upon, that there was no
stranger in the house and that he might enter when he pleased,&mdash;only
then would the old man softly open the door, with a joyous
smile, rubbing his hands together with delight, and betake
himself to Pokrovsky's room. He was his father.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4788" id="Page_4788">[Pg 4788]</a></span>
Afterward I learned in detail the story of this poor old man. Once
upon a time he had been in the government service somewhere or other,
but he had not the slightest capacity, and his place in the service
was the lowest and most insignificant of all. When his first wife died
(the mother of the student Pokrovsky), he took it into his head to
marry again, and wedded a woman from the petty-merchant class. Under
the rule of this new wife, everything was at sixes and sevens in his
house; there was no living with her; she drew a tight rein over
everybody. Student Pokrovsky was a boy at that time, ten years of age.
His stepmother hated him. But fate was kind to little Pokrovsky.
Bykoff, a landed proprietor, who was acquainted with Pokrovsky the
father and had formerly been his benefactor, took the child under his
protection and placed him in a school. He took an interest in him
because he had known his dead mother, whom Anna Feodorovna had
befriended while she was still a girl, and who had married her off to
Pokrovsky. From school young Pokrovsky entered a gymnasium, and then
the University, but his impaired health prevented his continuing his
studies there. Mr. Bykoff introduced him to Anna Feodorovna,
recommended him to her, and in this way young Pokrovsky had been taken
into the house as a boarder, on condition that he should teach Sasha
all that was necessary.</p>

<p>But old Pokrovsky fell into the lowest dissipation through grief at
his wife's harshness, and was almost always in a state of drunkenness.
His wife beat him, drove him into the kitchen to live, and brought
matters to such a point that at last he got used to being beaten and
ill-treated, and made no complaint. He was still far from being an old
man, but his evil habits had nearly destroyed his mind. The only sign
in him of noble human sentiments was his boundless love for his son.
It was said that young Pokrovsky was as like his dead mother as two
drops of water to each other. The old man could talk of nothing but
his son, and came to see him regularly twice a week. He dared not come
more frequently, because young Pokrovsky could not endure his father's
visits. Of all his failings, the first and greatest, without a doubt,
was his lack of respect for his father. However, the old man certainly
was at times the most intolerable creature in the world. In the first
place he was dreadfully inquisitive; in the second, by his chatter and
questions he interfered with his son's occupations; and lastly, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4789" id="Page_4789">[Pg 4789]</a></span>
sometimes presented himself in a state of intoxication. The son broke
the father, in a degree, of his faults,&mdash;of his inquisitiveness and
his chattering; and ultimately brought about such a condition of
affairs that the latter listened to all he said as to an oracle, and
dared not open his mouth without his permission.</p>

<p>There were no bounds to the old man's admiration of and delight in his
Petinka, as he called his son. When he came to visit him he almost
always wore a rather anxious, timid expression, probably on account of
his uncertainty as to how his son would receive him, and generally
could not make up his mind for a long time to go in; and if I happened
to be present, he would question me for twenty minutes: How was
Petinka? Was he well? In what mood was he, and was not he occupied in
something important? What, precisely, was he doing? Was he writing, or
engaged in meditation? When I had sufficiently encouraged and soothed
him, the old man would at last make up his mind to enter, and would
open the door very, very softly, very, very cautiously, and stick his
head in first; and if he saw that his son was not angry, and nodded to
him, he would step gently into the room, take off his little coat, and
his hat, which was always crumpled, full of holes and with broken
rims, and hang them on a hook, doing everything very softly, and
inaudibly. Then he would seat himself cautiously on a chair and never
take his eyes from his son, but would watch his every movement in his
desire to divine the state of his Petinka's temper. If the son was not
exactly in the right mood, and the old man detected it, he instantly
rose from his seat and explained, "I only ran in for a minute,
Petinka. I have been walking a good ways, and happened to be passing
by, so I came in to rest myself." And then silently he took his poor
little coat and his wretched little hat, opened the door again very
softly, and went away, forcing a smile in order to suppress the grief
which was seething up in his soul, and not betray it to his son.</p>

<p>But when the son received his father well, the old man was beside
himself with joy. His satisfaction shone forth in his face, in his
gestures, in his movements. If his son addressed a remark to him, the
old man always rose a little from his chair, and replied softly,
cringingly, almost reverently, and always made an effort to employ
the most select, that is to say, the most ridiculous expressions.
But he had not the gift of language; he always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4790" id="Page_4790">[Pg 4790]</a></span>
became confused and frightened, so that he did not know what to do
with his hands, or what to do with his person, and went on, for a long
time afterward, whispering his answer to himself, as though desirous
of recovering his composure. But if he succeeded in making a good
answer, the old man gained courage, set his waistcoat to rights, and
his cravat and his coat, and assumed an air of personal dignity.
Sometimes his courage rose to such a point, his daring reached such a
height, that he rose gently from his chair, went up to the shelf of
books, took down a book. He did all this with an air of artificial
indifference and coolness, as though he could always handle his son's
books in this proprietary manner, as though his son's caresses were no
rarity to him. But I once happened to witness the old man's fright
when Pokrovsky asked him not to touch his books. He became confused,
hurriedly replaced the book upside down, then tried to put it right,
turned it round and set it wrong side to, leaves out, smiled,
reddened, and did not know how to expiate his crime.</p>

<p>One day old Pokrovsky came in to see us. He chatted with us for a long
time, was unusually cheerful, alert, talkative; he laughed and joked
after his fashion, and at last revealed the secret of his raptures,
and announced to us that his Petinka's birthday fell precisely a week
later, and that it was his intention to call upon his son, without
fail, on that day; that he would don a new waistcoat, and that his
wife had promised to buy him some new boots. In short, the old man was
perfectly happy, and chattered about everything that came into his
head.</p>

<p>His birthday! That birthday gave me no peace, either day or night. I
made up my mind faithfully to remind Pokrovsky of my friendship, and
to make him a present. But what? At last I hit upon the idea of giving
him some books. I knew that he wished to own the complete works of
Pushkin, in the latest edition. I had thirty rubles of my own, earned
by my handiwork. I had put this money aside for a new gown. I
immediately sent old Matryona, our cook, to inquire the price of a
complete set. Alas! The price of the eleven volumes, together with the
expenses of binding, would be sixty rubles at the very least. I
thought and thought, but could not tell what to do. I did not wish to
ask my mother. Of course she would have helped me; but, in that case
every one in the house would have known about our gift; moreover, the
gift would have been converted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4791" id="Page_4791">[Pg 4791]</a></span>
into an expression of gratitude, a payment for Pokrovsky's labors for
the whole year. My desire was to make the present privately, unknown
to any one. And for his toilsome lessons to me I wished to remain
forever indebted to him, without any payment whatever. At last I
devised an escape from my predicament. I knew that one could often buy
at half price from the old booksellers in the Gostinny Dvor, if one
bargained well, little used and almost entirely new books. I made up
my mind to go to the Gostinny Dvor myself. So it came about; the very
next morning both Anna Feodorovna and we needed something. Mamma was
not feeling well, and Anna Feodorovna, quite opportunely, had a fit of
laziness, so all the errands were turned over to me, and I set out
with Matryona.</p>

<p>To my delight I soon found a Pushkin, and in a very handsome binding.
I began to bargain for it. How I enjoyed it! But alas! My entire
capital consisted of thirty rubles in paper, and the merchant would
not consent to accept less than ten rubles in silver. At last I began
to entreat him, and I begged and begged, until eventually he yielded.
But he only took off two rubles and a half, and swore that he had done
so only for my sake, because I was such a nice young lady, and that he
would not have come down in his price for any one else. Two rubles and
a half were still lacking! I was ready to cry with vexation. But the
most unexpected circumstance came to my rescue in my grief. Not far
from me, at another stall, I caught sight of old Pokrovsky. Four or
five old booksellers were clustered about him; he had completely lost
his wits, and they had thoroughly bewildered him. Each one was
offering him his wares, and what stuff they were offering, and what
all was he not ready to buy! I stepped up to him and asked him what he
was doing there? The old man was very glad to see me; he loved me
unboundedly,&mdash;no less than his Petinka, perhaps. "Why, I am buying a
few little books, Varvara Alexievna," he replied; "I am buying some
books for Petinka." I asked him if he had much money? "See
here,"&mdash;and the poor old man took out all his money, which was
wrapped up in a dirty scrap of newspaper; "here's a half-ruble, and a
twenty-kopek piece, and twenty kopeks in copper coins." I immediately
dragged him off to my bookseller. "Here are eleven books, which cost
altogether thirty-two rubles and a half; I have thirty; put your two
rubles and a half with mine, and we will buy all these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4792" id="Page_4792">[Pg 4792]</a></span>
books and give them to him in partnership." The old man was quite
beside himself with joy, and the bookseller loaded him down with our
common library.</p>

<p>The next day the old man came to see his son, sat with him a little
while, then came to us and sat down beside me with a very comical air
of mystery. Every moment he grew more sad and uneasy; at last he could
hold out no longer.</p>

<p>"Listen, Varvara Alexievna," he began timidly, in a low voice: "do you
know what, Varvara Alexievna?" The old man was dreadfully embarrassed.
"You see, when his birthday comes, do you take ten of those little
books and give them to him yourself, that is to say, from yourself, on
your own behalf; then I will take the eleventh and give it from
myself, for my share. So you see, you will have something to give, and
I shall have something to give; we shall both have something to give."</p>

<p>I was awfully sorry for the old man. I did not take long to think it
over. The old man watched me anxiously. "Listen to me, Zakhar
Petrovitch," I said: "do you give him all."&mdash;"How all? Do you mean all
the books?"&mdash;"Yes, certainly, all the books."&mdash;"And from
myself?"&mdash;"From yourself."&mdash;"From myself alone&mdash;that is, in my own
name?"&mdash;"Yes, in your own name." I thought I was expressing myself
with sufficient clearness, but the old man could not understand me for
a long time.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained to me at last, "I sometimes indulge myself,
Varvara Alexievna,&mdash;that is to say, I wish to state to you that I
nearly always indulge myself,&mdash;I do that which is not right,&mdash;that is,
you know, when it is cold out of doors, and when various unpleasant
things happen at times, or when I feel sad for any reason, or
something bad happens,&mdash;then sometimes, I do not restrain myself, and
I drink too much. This is very disagreeable to Petrushka, you see,
Varvara Alexievna; he gets angry, and he scolds me and reads me moral
lectures. So now I should like to show him by my gift that I have
reformed, and am beginning to conduct myself well; that I have been
saving up my money to buy a book, saving for a long time, because I
hardly ever have any money, except when it happens that Petrushka
gives me some now and then. He knows that. Consequently, he will see
what use I have made of my money, and he will know that I have done
this for his sake alone."...</p>

<p>"Well, yes," he said, after thinking it over, "yes! That will
be very fine, that would be very fine indeed,&mdash;only, what are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4793" id="Page_4793">[Pg 4793]</a></span>
you going to do, Varvara Alexievna?"&mdash;"Why, I shall not give
anything."&mdash;"What!" cried the old man almost in terror; "so you
will not give Petinka anything, so you do not wish to give him
anything?" He was alarmed. At that moment it seemed as though he were
ready to relinquish his own suggestions, so that I might have
something to give his son. He was a kind-hearted old man! I explained
that I would be glad to give something, only I did not wish to deprive
him of the pleasure.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the festive day he made his appearance at precisely eleven o'clock,
straight from the mass, in his dress coat, decently patched, and
actually in a new waistcoat and new boots. We were all sitting in the
hall with Anna Feodorovna, and drinking coffee (it was Sunday). The
old man began, I believe, by saying that Pushkin was a good poet; then
he lost the thread of his discourse and got confused, and suddenly
jumped to the assertion that a man must behave well, and that if he
does not behave himself well, then it simply means that he indulges
himself; he even cited several terrible examples of intemperance, and
wound up by stating that for some time past he had been entirely a
reformed character, and that he now behaved with perfect propriety.
That even earlier he had recognized the justice of his son's
exhortations, and had treasured them all in his heart, and had
actually begun to be sober. In proof of which he now presented these
books, which had been purchased with money which he had been hoarding
up for a long time.</p>

<p>I could not refrain from tears and laughter, as I listened to the poor
old fellow; he knew well how to lie when the occasion demanded! The
books were taken to Pokrovsky's room and placed on the shelf.
Pokrovsky immediately divined the truth.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Pokrovsky fell ill, two months after the events which I have described
above. During those two months he had striven incessantly for the means
of existence, for up to that time he had never had a settled position.
Like all consumptives, he bade farewell only with his last breath to the
hope of a very long life.... Anna Feodorovna herself made all the
arrangements about the funeral. She bought the very plainest sort
of a coffin, and hired a truckman. In order to repay herself for her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4794" id="Page_4794">[Pg 4794]</a></span>
expenditure, Anna Feodorovna took possession of all the dead man's
books and effects. The old man wrangled with her, raised an uproar,
snatched from her as many books as possible, stuffed all his pockets
with them, thrust them into his hat and wherever he could, carried
them about with him all the three days which preceded the funeral, and
did not even part with them when the time came to go to the church.
During all those days he was like a man stunned, who has lost his
memory, and he kept fussing about near the coffin with a certain
strange anxiety; now he adjusted the paper band upon the dead man's
brow, now he lighted and snuffed the candles. It was evident that he
could not fix his thoughts in orderly manner on anything. Neither my
mother nor Anna Feodorovna went to the funeral services in the church.
My mother was ill, but Anna Feodorovna quarreled with old Pokrovsky
just as she was all ready to start, and so stayed away. The old man
and I were the only persons present. A sort of fear came over me
during the services&mdash;like the presentiment of something which was
about to happen. I could hardly stand out the ceremony in church. At
last they put the lid on the coffin and nailed it down, placed it on
the cart and drove away. I accompanied it only to the end of the
street. The truckman drove at a trot. The old man ran after the cart,
weeping aloud; the sound of his crying was broken and shaken by his
running. The poor man lost his hat and did not stop to pick it up. His
head was wet with the rain; the sleet lashed and cut his face. The old
man did not appear to feel the bad weather, but ran weeping from one
side of the cart to the other. The skirts of his shabby old coat waved
in the wind like wings. Books protruded from every one of his pockets;
in his hands was a huge book, which he held tightly clutched. The
passers-by removed their hats and made the sign of the cross. Some
halted and stared in amazement at the poor old man. Every moment the
books kept falling out of his pockets into the mud, People stopped
him, and pointed out his losses to him; he picked them up, and set out
again in pursuit of the coffin. At the corner of the street an old
beggar woman joined herself to him to escort the coffin. At last the
cart turned the corner, and disappeared from my eyes. I went home, I
flung myself, in dreadful grief, on my mother's bosom.</p>

<h4><a name="LetterII" id="LetterII"></a><span class="smcap">Letter from Makar Dyevushkin to Varvara Alexievna Dobrosyeloff</span></h4>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">September 9th</span>.</p>
<p><i>My dear Varvara Alexievna!</i></p>

<p>I am quite beside myself as I write this. I am utterly upset by a most
terrible occurrence. My head is whirling. I feel as though everything
were turning in dizzy circles round about me. Ah, my dearest, what a
thing I have to tell you now! We had not even a presentiment of such a
thing. No, I don't believe that I did not have a presentiment&mdash;I
foresaw it all. My heart forewarned me of this whole thing! I even
dreamed of something like it not long ago.</p>

<p>This is what has happened! I will relate it to you without attempting
fine style, and as the Lord shall put it into my soul. I went to the
office to-day. When I arrived, I sat down and began to write. But you
must know, my dear, that I wrote yesterday also. Well, yesterday
Timofei Ivan'itch came to me, and was pleased to give me a personal
order. "Here's a document that is much needed," says he, "and we're in
a hurry for it. Copy it, Makar Alexievitch," says he, "as quickly and
as neatly and carefully as possible: it must be handed in for
signature to-day." I must explain to you, my angel, that I was not
quite myself yesterday, and didn't wish to look at anything; such
sadness and depression had fallen upon me! My heart was cold, my mind
was dark; you filled all my memory, and incessantly, my poor darling.
Well, so I set to work on the copy; I wrote clearly and well, only,&mdash;I
don't know exactly how to describe it to you, whether the Evil One
himself tangled me up, or whether it was decreed by some mysterious
fate, or simply whether it was bound to happen so, but I omitted a
whole line, and the sense was utterly ruined. The Lord only knows what
sense there was&mdash;simply none whatever. They were late with the papers
yesterday, so they only gave this document to his Excellency for
signature this morning. To-day I presented myself at the usual hour,
as though nothing at all were the matter, and set myself down
alongside Emelyan Ivanovitch.</p>

<p>I must tell you, my dear, that lately I have become twice as
shamefaced as before, and more mortified. Of late I have ceased to
look at any one. As soon as any one's chair squeaks, I am more
dead than alive. So to-day I crept in, slipped humbly into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4796" id="Page_4796">[Pg 4796]</a></span>
my seat, and sat there all doubled up, so that Efim Akimovitch (he's the
greatest tease in the world) remarked in such a way that all could hear him,
"Why do you sit so like a y-y-y, Makar Alexievitch?" Then he made such
a grimace that everybody round him and me split with laughter, and of
course at my expense. They kept it up interminably! I drooped my ears
and screwed up my eyes, and sat there motionless. That's my way; they
stop the quicker. All at once I heard a noise, a running and a tumult;
I heard&mdash;did my ears deceive me? They were calling for me, demanding
me, summoning Dyevushkin. My heart quivered in my breast, and I didn't
know myself what I feared, for nothing of the sort had ever happened
to me in the whole course of my life. I was rooted to my chair,&mdash;as
though nothing had occurred, as though it were not I. But then they
began again, nearer at hand, and nearer still. And here they were,
right in my very ear: "Dyevushkin! Dyevushkin!" they called; "where's
Dyevushkin?" I raise my eyes, and there before me stands Evstafiy
Ivanovitch; he says:&mdash;"Makar Alexievitch, hasten to his Excellency as
quickly as possible! You've made a nice mess with that document!"</p>

<p>That was all he said, but it was enough, wasn't it, my dear,&mdash;quite
enough to say? I turned livid, and grew as cold as ice, and lost my
senses; I started, and I simply didn't know whether I was alive or
dead as I went. They led me through one room, and through another
room, and through a third room, to the private office, and I presented
myself! Positively, I cannot give you any account of what I was
thinking about. I saw his Excellency standing there, with all of them
around him. It appears that I did not make my salute; I forgot it
completely. I was so scared that my lips trembled and my legs shook.
And there was sufficient cause, my dear. In the first place, I was
ashamed of myself; I glanced to the right, at a mirror, and what I
beheld therein was enough to drive any man out of his senses. And in
the second place, I have always behaved as though there were no place
for me in the world. So that it is not likely that his Excellency was
even aware of my existence. It is possible that he may have heard it
cursorily mentioned that there was a person named Dyevushkin in the
department, but he had never come into any closer relations.</p>

<p>He began angrily, "What's the meaning of this, sir? What are
you staring at? Here's an important paper, needed in haste,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4797" id="Page_4797">[Pg 4797]</a></span>
and you go and spoil it. And how did you come to permit such a thing?" Here his
Excellency turned on Evstafiy Ivanovitch. I only listen, and the
sounds of the words reach me: "It's gross carelessness. Heedlessness!
You'll get yourself into trouble!" I tried to open my mouth for some
purpose or other. I seemed to want to ask forgiveness, but I couldn't;
to run away, but I didn't dare to make the attempt: and then&mdash;then, my
dearest, something so dreadful happened that I can hardly hold my pen
even now for the shame of it. My button&mdash;deuce take it&mdash;my button,
which was hanging by a thread, suddenly broke loose, jumped off,
skipped along (evidently I had struck it by accident), clattered and
rolled away, the cursed thing, straight to his Excellency's feet, and
that in the midst of universal silence. And that was the whole of my
justification, all my excuse, all my answer, everything which I was
preparing to say to his Excellency!</p>

<p>The results were terrible! His Excellency immediately directed his
attention to my figure and my costume. I remembered what I had seen in
the mirror; I flew to catch the button! A fit of madness descended
upon me! I bent down and tried to grasp the button, but it rolled and
twisted, and I couldn't get hold of it, in short, and I also
distinguished myself in the matter of dexterity. Then I felt my last
strength fail me, and knew that all, all was lost! My whole reputation
was lost, the whole man ruined! And then, without rhyme or reason,
Teresa and Faldoni began to ring in both my ears. At last I succeeded
in seizing the button, rose upright, drew myself up in proper salute,
but like a fool, and stood calmly there with my hands lined down on
the seams of my trousers! No, I didn't, though. I began to try to fit
the button on the broken thread, just as though it would stick fast by
that means; and moreover, I began to smile and went on smiling.</p>

<p>At first his Excellency turned away; then he scrutinized me again, and
I heard him say to Evstafiy Ivanovitch:&mdash;"How's this? See what a
condition he is in! What a looking man! What's the matter with him?"
Ah, my own dearest, think of that&mdash;"What a looking man!" and "What's
the matter with him!"&mdash;"He has distinguished himself!" I heard
Evstafiy say; "he has no bad marks, no bad marks on any score, and his
conduct is exemplary; his salary is adequate, in accordance with the
rates." "Well then, give him some sort of assistance," says his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4798" id="Page_4798">[Pg 4798]</a></span>
Excellency; "make him an advance on his salary."&mdash;"But he has had it,
he has taken it already, for ever so long in advance. Probably
circumstances have compelled him to do so; but his conduct is good,
and he has received no reprimands, he has never been rebuked." My dear
little angel, I turned hot and burned as though in the fires of the
bad place! I was on the point of fainting. "Well," says his Excellency
in a loud voice, "the document must be copied again as quickly as
possible; come here, Dyevushkin, make a fresh copy without errors; and
listen to me;" here his Excellency turned to the others and gave them
divers orders, and sent them all away. As soon as they were all gone,
his Excellency hastily took out his pocket-book, and from it drew a
hundred-ruble bank-note. "Here," said he, "this is all I can afford,
and I am happy to help to that extent; reckon it as you please, take
it,"&mdash;and he thrust it into my hand. I trembled, my angel, my whole
soul was in a flutter; I didn't know what was the matter with me; I
tried to catch his hand and kiss it. But he turned very red in the
face, my darling, and&mdash;I am not deviating from the truth by so much as
a hair's-breadth&mdash;he took my unworthy hand, and shook it, indeed he
did; he took it and shook it as though it were of equal rank with his
own, as though it belonged to a General like himself. "Go," says he;
"I am glad to do what I can. Make no mistakes, but now do it as well
as you can."</p>

<p>Now, my dear, this is what I have decided: I beg you and Feodor&mdash;and
if I had children I would lay my commands upon them&mdash;to pray to God
for him; though they should not pray for their own father, that they
should pray daily and forever, for his Excellency! One thing more I
will say, my dearest, and I say it solemnly,&mdash;heed me well, my
dear,&mdash;I swear that, no matter in what degree I may be reduced to
spiritual anguish in the cruel days of our adversity, as I look on you
and your poverty, on myself, on my humiliation and incapacity,&mdash;in
spite of all this, I swear to you that the hundred rubles are not so
precious to me as the fact that his Excellency himself deigned to
press my unworthy hand, the hand of a straw, a drunkard! Thereby he
restored my self-respect. By that deed he brought to life again my
spirit, he made my existence sweeter forevermore, and I am firmly
convinced that, however sinful I may be in the sight of the Almighty,
yet my prayer for the happiness and prosperity of his Excellency will
reach his throne!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4799" id="Page_4799">[Pg 4799]</a></span>
My dearest, I am at present in the most terrible state of spiritual
prostration, in a horribly overwrought condition. My heart beats as
though it would burst out of my breast, and I seem to be weak all
over. I send you forty-five rubles, paper money. I shall give twenty
rubles to my landlady, and keep thirty-five for myself; with twenty I
will get proper clothes, and the other fifteen will go for my living
expenses. But just now all the impressions of this morning have shaken
my whole being to the foundations. I am going to lie down for a bit.
Nevertheless, I am calm, perfectly calm. Only, my soul aches, and down
there, in the depths, my soul is trembling and throbbing and
quivering. I shall go to see you; but just now I am simply intoxicated
with all these emotions. God sees all, my dearest, my own darling, my
precious one.</p>

<h3><a name="BIBLE" id="BIBLE"></a>THE BIBLE READING</h3>

<h4>From 'Crime and Punishment'</h4>


<p>Raskolnikoff went straight to the water-side, where Sonia was living.
The three-storied house was an old building, painted green. The young
man had some difficulty in finding the dvornik, and got from him vague
information about the quarters of the tailor Kapernasumoff. After
having discovered in a corner of the yard the foot of a steep and
gloomy staircase, he ascended to the second floor, and followed the
gallery facing the court-yard. Whilst groping in the dark, and asking
himself how Kapernasumoff's lodgings could be reached, a door opened
close to him; he seized it mechanically.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked a timid female voice.</p>

<p>"It is I. I am coming to see you," replied Raskolnikoff, on entering a
small ante-room. There on a wretched table stood a candle, fixed in a
candlestick of twisted metal.</p>

<p>"Is that you? Good heavens!" feebly replied Sonia, who seemed not to
have strength enough to move from the spot.</p>

<p>"Where do you live? Is it here?" And Raskolnikoff passed quickly into
the room, trying not to look the girl in the face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4800" id="Page_4800">[Pg 4800]</a></span>
A moment afterwards Sonia rejoined him with the candle, and remained
stock still before him, a prey to an indescribable agitation. This
unexpected visit had upset her&mdash;nay, even frightened her. All of a
sudden her pale face colored up, and tears came into her eyes. She
experienced extreme confusion, united with a certain gentle feeling.
Raskolnikoff turned aside with a rapid movement and sat down on a
chair, close to the table. In the twinkling of an eye he took stock of
everything in the room.</p>

<p>This room was large, with a very low ceiling, and was the only one let
out by the Kapernasumoffs; in the wall, on the left-hand side, was a
door giving access to theirs. On the opposite side, in the wall on the
right, there was another door, which was always locked. That was
another lodging, having another number. Sonia's room was more like an
out-house, of irregular rectangular shape, which gave it an uncommon
character. The wall, with its three windows facing the canal, cut it
obliquely, forming thus an extremely acute angle, in the back portion
of which nothing could be seen, considering the feeble light of the
candle. On the other hand, the other angle was an extremely obtuse
one. This large room contained scarcely any furniture. In the
right-hand corner was the bed; between the bed and the door, a chair;
on the same side, facing the door of the next set, stood a deal table,
covered with a blue cloth; close to the table were two rush chairs.
Against the opposite wall, near the acute angle, was placed a small
chest of drawers of unvarnished wood, which seemed out of place in
this vacant spot. This was the whole of the furniture. The yellowish
and worn paper had everywhere assumed a darkish color, probably the
effect of the damp and coal smoke. Everything in the place denoted
poverty. Even the bed had no curtains. Sonia silently considered the
visitor, who examined her room so attentively and so unceremoniously.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Her lot is fixed," thought he,&mdash;"a watery grave, the mad-house,
or a brutish existence!" This latter contingency was especially repellent
to him, but skeptic as he was, he could not help believing it a possibility.
"Is it possible that such is really the case?" he asked himself. "Is it
possible that this creature, who still retains a pure mind, should end by
becoming deliberately mire-like? Has she not already become familiar with
it, and if up to the present she has been able to bear with such a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4801" id="Page_4801">[Pg 4801]</a></span>
life, has it not been so because vice has already lost its hideousness
in her eyes? Impossible again!" cried he, on his part, in the same way
as Sonia had cried a moment ago. "No, that which up to the present has
prevented her from throwing herself into the canal has been the fear
of sin and its punishment. May she not be mad after all? Who says she
is not so? Is she in full possession of all her faculties? Is it
possible to speak as she does? Do people of sound judgment reason as
she reasons? Can people anticipate future destruction with such
tranquillity, turning a deaf ear to warnings and forebodings? Does she
expect a miracle? It must be so. And does not all this seem like signs
of mental derangement?"</p>

<p>To this idea he clung obstinately. Sonia mad! Such a prospect
displeased him less than the other ones. Once more he examined the
girl attentively. "And you&mdash;you often pray to God, Sonia?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>No answer. Standing by her side, he waited for a reply. "What could I
be, what should I be without God?" cried she in a low-toned but
energetic voice, and whilst casting on Raskolnikoff a rapid glance of
her brilliant eyes, she gripped his hand.</p>

<p>"Come, I was not mistaken!" he muttered to himself.&mdash;"And what does
God do for you?" asked he, anxious to clear his doubts yet more.</p>

<p>For a long time the girl remained silent, as if incapable of reply.
Emotion made her bosom heave. "Stay! Do not question me! You have no
such right!" exclaimed she, all of a sudden, with looks of anger.</p>

<p>"I expected as much!" was the man's thought.</p>

<p>"God does everything for me!" murmured the girl rapidly, and her eyes
sank.</p>

<p>"At last I have the explanation!" he finished mentally, whilst eagerly
looking at her.</p>

<p>He experienced a new, strange, almost unhealthy feeling on watching
this pale, thin, hard-featured face, these blue and soft eyes which
could yet dart such lights and give utterance to such passion; in a
word, this feeble frame, yet trembling with indignation and anger,
struck him as weird,&mdash;nay, almost fantastic. "Mad! she must be mad!"
he muttered once more. A book was lying on the chest of drawers.
Raskolnikoff had noticed it more than once whilst moving about the
room. He took it and examined it. It was a Russian translation of the
Gospels, a well-thumbed leather-bound book.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4802" id="Page_4802">[Pg 4802]</a></span>
"Where does that come from?" asked he of Sonia, from the other end of
the room.</p>

<p>The girl still held the same position, a pace or two from the table.
"It was lent me," replied Sonia, somewhat loth, without looking at
Raskolnikoff.</p>

<p>"Who lent it you?"</p>

<p>"Elizabeth&mdash;I asked her to!"</p>

<p>"Elizabeth. How strange!" he thought. Everything with Sonia assumed to
his mind an increasingly extraordinary aspect. He took the book to the
light, and turned it over. "Where is mention made of Lazarus?" asked
he abruptly.</p>

<p>Sonia, looking hard on the ground, preserved silence, whilst moving
somewhat from the table.</p>

<p>"Where is mention made of the resurrection of Lazarus? Find me the
passage, Sonia."</p>

<p>The latter looked askance at her interlocutor. "That is not the
place&mdash;it is the Fourth Gospel," said she dryly, without moving from
the spot.</p>

<p>"Find me the passage and read it out!" he repeated, and sitting down
again rested his elbow on the table, his head on his hand, and
glancing sideways with gloomy look, prepared to listen.</p>

<p>Sonia at first hesitated to draw nearer to the table. The singular
wish uttered by Raskolnikoff scarcely seemed sincere. Nevertheless she
took the book. "Have you ever read the passage?" she asked him,
looking at him from out the corners of her eyes. Her voice was getting
harder and harder.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time. In my childhood. Read!"</p>

<p>"Have you never heard it in church?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I never go there. Do you go often yourself?"</p>

<p>"No," stammered Sonia.</p>

<p>Raskolnikoff smiled. "I understand, then, you won't go tomorrow to
your father's funeral service?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I was at church last week. I was present at a requiem mass."</p>

<p>"Whose was that?"</p>

<p>"Elizabeth's. She was assassinated by means of an axe."</p>

<p>Raskolnikoff's nervous system became more and more irritated. He was
getting giddy. "Were you friends with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She was straightforward. She used to come and see me&mdash;but not
often. She was not able. We used to read and chat. She sees God."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4803" id="Page_4803">[Pg 4803]</a></span>
Raskolnikoff became thoughtful. "What," asked he himself, "could be
the meaning of the mysterious interviews of two such idiots as Sonia
and Elizabeth? Why, I should go mad here myself!" thought he. "Madness
seems to be in the atmosphere of the place!&mdash;Read!" he cried all of a
sudden, irritably.</p>

<p>Sonia kept hesitating. Her heart beat loud. She seemed afraid to read.
He considered "this poor demented creature" with an almost sad
expression. "How can that interest you, since you do not believe?" she
muttered in a choking voice.</p>

<p>"Read! I insist upon it! Used you not to read to Elizabeth?"</p>

<p>Sonia opened the book and looked for the passage. Her hands trembled.
The words stuck in her throat. Twice did she try to read without being
able to utter the first syllable.</p>

<p>"Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany," she read, at
last, with an effort; but suddenly, at the third word, her voice grew
wheezy, and gave way like an overstretched chord. Breath was deficient
in her oppressed bosom. Raskolnikoff partly explained to himself
Sonia's hesitation to obey him; and in proportion as he understood her
better, he insisted still more imperiously on her reading. He felt
what it must cost the girl to lay bare to him, to some extent, her
heart of hearts. She evidently could not, without difficulty, make up
her mind to confide to a stranger the sentiments which probably since
her teens had been her support, her <i>viaticum</i>&mdash;when, what with a
sottish father and a stepmother demented by misfortune, to say nothing
of starving children, she heard nothing but reproach and offensive
clamor. He saw all this, but he likewise saw that notwithstanding this
repugnance, she was most anxious to read,&mdash;to read to him, and that
now,&mdash;let the consequences be what they may! The girl's look, the
agitation to which she was a prey, told him as much, and by a violent
effort over herself Sonia conquered the spasm which parched her
throat, and continued to read the eleventh chapter of the Gospel
according to St. John. She thus reached the nineteenth verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort
them concerning their brother. Then Martha, as soon as she heard
that Jesus was coming, went and met him; but Mary sat still in the
house. Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here,
my brother had not died. But I know that even now, whatsoever
thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4804" id="Page_4804">[Pg 4804]</a></span>
Here she paused, to overcome the emotion which once more
caused her voice to tremble.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith
unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the
last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the Resurrection and the Life;
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest
thou this? She saith unto him,"&mdash;</p></div>

<p>and although she had difficulty in breathing, Sonia raised her
voice, as if in reading the words of Martha she was making her
own confession of faith:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God,
which should come into the world."</p></div>

<p>She stopped, raised her eyes rapidly on him, but cast them
down on her book, and continued to read. Raskolnikoff listened
without stirring, without turning toward her, his elbows resting
on the table, looking aside. Thus the reading continued till the
thirty-second verse.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she
fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here,
my brother had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping,
and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the
spirit and was troubled, and said, Where have ye laid him? They
said unto him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept. Then said the
Jews, Behold how he loved him. And some of them said, Could not
this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even
this man should not have died?"</p></div>

<p>Raskolnikoff turned towards her and looked at her with agitation. His
suspicion was a correct one. She was trembling in all her limbs, a
prey to fever. He had expected this. She was getting to the miraculous
story, and a feeling of triumph was taking possession of her. Her
voice, strengthened by joy, had a metallic ring. The lines became
misty to her troubled eyes, but fortunately she knew the passage by
heart. At the last line, "Could not this man, which opened the eyes of
the blind&mdash;" she lowered her voice, emphasizing passionately the
doubt, the blame, the reproach of these unbelieving and blind Jews,
who a moment after fell as if struck by lightning on their knees, to
sob and to believe. "Yes," thought she, deeply affected by this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4805" id="Page_4805">[Pg 4805]</a></span>
joyful hope, "yes, he&mdash;he who is blind, who dares not believe&mdash;he also
will hear&mdash;will believe in an instant, immediately, now, this very
moment!"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the grave.
It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, Take ye away
the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him,
Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days."</p></div>

<p>She strongly emphasized the word <i>four</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Jesus saith unto her. Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldst
believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God? Then they took away
the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted
up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people
which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent
me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
Lazarus, come forth. <i>And he that was dead came forth,</i>"&mdash;</p></div>

<p>(on reading these words Sonia shuddered, as if she herself had
been witness to the miracle)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound
about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him
go. <i>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed on him.</i>"</p></div>

<p>She read no more,&mdash;such a thing would have been impossible
to her,&mdash;closed the book, and briskly rising, said in a low-toned
and choking voice, without turning toward the man she was
talking to, "So much for the resurrection of Lazarus." She
seemed afraid to raise her eyes on Raskolnikoff, whilst her feverish
trembling continued. The dying piece of candle dimly lit up
this low-ceiled room, in which an assassin and a harlot had just
read the Book of books.</p>

<h4>(1843-)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/capw142.png" width="90" height="90" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><p class="dropcap">e are all hunters, skillful or skilless, in literature&mdash;hunters for
our spiritual good or for our pleasure," says Edward Dowden; and to
his earnest research and careful exposition many readers owe a more
thorough appreciation of literature. He was educated at Queen's
College, Cork (his birthplace), and then at Trinity College, Dublin,
where he received the Vice-Chancellor's prize in both English verse
and English prose, and also the first English Moderatorship in logic
and ethics. For two years he studied divinity. Then he obtained by
examination a professorship of oratory at the University of Dublin,
where he was afterwards elected professor of English literature. The
scholarship of his literary work has won him many honors. In 1888 he
was chosen president of the English Goethe Society, to succeed
Professor M&uuml;ller. The following year he was appointed first Taylorian
lecturer in the Taylor Institute, Oxford. The Royal Irish Academy has
bestowed the Cunningham gold medal upon him, and he has also received
the honorary degree LL. D. of the University of Edinburgh, and from
Princeton University.</p>

<p>Very early in life Professor Dowden began to express his feeling for
literature, and the instinct which leads him to account for a work by
study of its author's personality. For more than twenty years English
readers have known him as a frequent contributor of critical essays to
the leading reviews. These have been collected into the delightful
volumes 'Studies in Literature' and 'Transcripts and Studies.' His has
been called "an honest method, wholesome as sweet." He would offer
more than a mere r&eacute;sum&eacute; of what his author expresses. He would be one
of the interpreters and transmitters of new forms of thought to the
masses of readers who lack time or ability to discover values for
themselves. Very widely read himself, he is fitted for just
comparisons and comprehensive views. As has been pointed out, he is
fond of working from a general consideration of a period with its
formative influences, to the particular care of the author with whom
he is dealing. Saintsbury tells us that Mr. Dowden's procedure is to
ask his author a series of questions which seem to him of vital
importance, and find out how he would answer them.</p>

<p>Dowden's style is careful, clear, and thorough, showing his
scholarship and incisive thought. His form of expression is strongly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4807" id="Page_4807">[Pg 4807]</a></span>
picturesque. It is nowhere more so than in 'Shakespeare: a Study of
His Mind and Art.' This, his most noteworthy work, has been very
widely read and admired. His intimate acquaintance with German
criticism upon the great Elizabethan especially fitted him to present
fresh considerations to the public.</p>

<p>He has also written a brilliant 'Life of Shelley' (bitterly criticized
by Mark Twain in the North American Review, 'A Defense of Harriet
Shelley'), and a 'Life of Southey' in the English Men of Letters
Series; and edited most capably 'Southey's Correspondence with
Caroline Bowles,' 'The Correspondence of Sir Henry Taylor,'
'Shakespeare's Sonnets,' 'The Passionate Pilgrim,' and a collection of
'Lyrical Ballads.'</p>

<h3><a name="HUMOR" id="HUMOR"></a>THE HUMOR OF SHAKESPEARE</h3>

<h4>From 'Shakespeare: a Critical Study of His Mind and Art'</h4>

<p>A study of Shakespeare which fails to take account of Shakespeare's
humor must remain essentially incomplete. The character and spiritual
history of a man who is endowed with a capacity for humorous
appreciation of the world must differ throughout, and in every
particular, from that of the man whose moral nature has never rippled
over with genial laughter. At whatever final issue Shakespeare arrived
after long spiritual travail as to the attainment of his life, that
precise issue, rather than another, was arrived at in part by virtue
of the fact of Shakespeare's humor. In the composition of forces which
determined the orbit traversed by the mind of the poet, this must be
allowed for as a force among others, in importance not the least, and
efficient at all times even when little apparent. A man whose visage
"holds one stern intent" from day to day, and whose joy becomes at
times almost a supernatural rapture, may descend through circles of
hell to the narrowest and the lowest; he may mount from sphere to
sphere of Paradise until he stands within the light of the Divine
Majesty; but he will hardly succeed in presenting us with an adequate
image of life as it is on this earth of ours, in its oceanic amplitude
and variety. A few men of genius there have been, who with vision
penetrative as lightning have gazed as it were <i>through</i> life, at some
eternal significances of which life is the symbol. Intent upon its
sacred meaning, they have had no eye to note the forms of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4808" id="Page_4808">[Pg 4808]</a></span>
grotesque hieroglyph of human existence. Such men are not framed for
laughter. To this little group the creator of Falstaff, of Bottom, and
of Touchstone does not belong.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, who saw life more widely and wisely than any other of the
seers, could laugh. That is a comfortable fact to bear in mind; a fact
which serves to rescue us from the domination of intense and narrow
natures, who claim authority by virtue of their grasp of one-half of
the realities of our existence and their denial of the rest.
Shakespeare could laugh. But we must go on to ask, "What did he laugh
at? and what was the manner of his laughter?" There are as many modes
of laughter as there are facets of the common soul of humanity, to
reflect the humorous appearances of the world. Hogarth, in one of his
pieces of coarse yet subtile engraving, has presented a group of
occupants of the pit of a theatre, sketched during the performance of
some broad comedy or farce. What proceeds upon the stage is invisible
and undiscoverable, save as we catch its reflection on the faces of
the spectators, in the same way that we infer a sunset from the
evening flame upon windows that front the west. Each laughing face in
Hogarth's print exhibits a different mode or a different stage of the
risible paroxysm. There is the habitual enjoyer of the broad comic,
abandoned to his mirth, which is open and unashamed; mirth which he is
evidently a match for, and able to sustain. By his side is a companion
female portrait&mdash;a woman with head thrown back to ease the violence of
the guffaw; all her loose redundant flesh is tickled into an orgasm of
merriment; she is fairly overcome. On the other side sits the
spectator who has passed the climax of his laughter; he wipes the
tears from his eyes, and is on the way to regain an insecure and
temporary composure. Below appears a girl of eighteen or twenty, whose
vacancy of intellect is captured and occupied by the innocuous folly
still in progress; she gazes on expectantly, assured that a new
blossom of the wonder of absurdity is about to display itself. Her
father, a man who does not often surrender himself to an indecent
convulsion, leans his face upon his hand, and with the other steadies
himself by grasping one of the iron spikes that inclose the orchestra.
In the right corner sits the humorist, whose eyes, around which the
wrinkles gather, are half closed, while he already goes over the jest
a second time in his imagination. At the opposite side an elderly
woman is seen, past the period when animal violences are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4809" id="Page_4809">[Pg 4809]</a></span>
possible, laughing because she knows there is something to laugh at, though she
is too dull-witted to know precisely what. One spectator, as we guess
from his introverted air, is laughing to think what somebody else
would think of this. Finally, the thin-lipped, perk-nosed person of
refinement looks aside, and by his critical indifference condemns the
broad, injudicious mirth of the company.</p>

<p>All these laughers of Hogarth are very commonplace, and some are very
vulgar persons; one trivial, ludicrous spectacle is the occasion of
their mirth. When from such laughter as this we turn to the laughter
of men of genius, who gaze at the total play of the world's life; and
when we listen to this, as with the ages it goes on gathering and
swelling, our sense of hearing is enveloped and almost annihilated by
the chorus of mock and jest, of antic and buffoonery, of tender mirth
and indignant satire, of monstrous burlesque and sly absurdity, of
desperate misanthropic derision and genial affectionate caressing of
human imperfection and human folly. We hear from behind the mask the
enormous laughter of Aristophanes, ascending peal above peal until it
passes into jubilant ecstasy, or from the uproar springs some
exquisite lyric strain. We hear laughter of passionate indignation
from Juvenal, the indignation of "the ancient and free soul of the
dead republics." And there is Rabelais, with his huge buffoonery, and
the earnest eyes intent on freedom, which look out at us in the midst
of the zany's tumblings and indecencies. And Cervantes, with his
refined Castilian air and deep melancholy mirth, at odds with the
enthusiasm which is dearest to his soul. And Moli&egrave;re, with his
laughter of unerring good sense, undeluded by fashion or vanity or
folly or hypocrisy, and brightly mocking these into modesty. And
Milton, with his fierce objurgatory laughter,&mdash;Elijah-like insult
against the enemies of freedom and of England. And Voltaire, with his
quick intellectual scorn and eager malice of the brain. And there is
the urbane and amiable play of Addison's invention, not capable of
large achievement, but stirring the corners of the mouth with a humane
smile,&mdash;gracious gayety for the breakfast-tables of England. And
Fielding's careless mastery of the whole broad common field of mirth.
And Sterne's exquisite curiosity of oddness, his subtile extravagances
and humors prepense. And there is the tragic laughter of Swift, which announces
the extinction of reason, and loss beyond recovery of human faith and charity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4810" id="Page_4810">[Pg 4810]</a></span>
and hope. How in this chorus of laughters, joyous and terrible,
is the laughter of Shakespeare distinguishable?</p>

<p>In the first place, the humor of Shakespeare, like his total
genius, is many-sided. He does not pledge himself as dramatist
to any one view of human life. If we open a novel by Charles
Dickens, we feel assured beforehand that we are condemned to
an exuberance of philanthropy; we know how the writer will
insist that we must all be good friends, all be men and brothers,
intoxicated with the delight of one another's presence; we expect
him to hold out the right hand of fellowship to man, woman, and
child; we are prepared for the bacchanalia of benevolence. The
lesson we have to learn from this teacher is, that with the
exception of a few inevitable and incredible monsters of cruelty,
every man naturally engendered of the offspring of Adam is of
his own nature inclined to every amiable virtue, Shakespeare
abounds in kindly mirth: he receives an exquisite pleasure from
the alert wit and bright good sense of a Rosalind; he can dandle
a fool as tenderly as any nurse qualified to take a baby from the
birth can deal with her charge. But Shakespeare is not pledged
to deep-dyed ultra-amiability. With Jacques, he can rail at the
world while remaining curiously aloof from all deep concern
about its interests, this way or that. With Timon he can turn
upon the world with a rage no less than that of Swift, and discover
in man and woman a creature as abominable as the Yahoo.
In other words, the humor of Shakespeare, like his total genius,
is dramatic.</p>

<p>Then again, although Shakespeare laughs incomparably, mere laughter
wearies him. The only play of Shakespeare's, out of nearly forty,
which is farcical,&mdash;'The Comedy of Errors,'&mdash;was written in
the poet's earliest period of authorship, and was formed upon the
suggestion of a preceding piece. It has been observed with truth by
Gervinus that the farcical incidents of this play have been connected
by Shakespeare with a tragic background, which is probably his own
invention. With beauty, or with pathos, or with thought, Shakespeare
can mingle his mirth; and then he is happy, and knows how to deal with
play of wit or humorous characterization; but an entirely comic
subject somewhat disconcerts the poet. On this ground, if no other
were forthcoming, it might be suspected that 'The Taming of the Shrew'
was not altogether the work of Shakespeare's hand. The secondary
intrigues and minor incidents were of little interest to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4811" id="Page_4811">[Pg 4811]</a></span>
the poet. But in the buoyant force of Petruchio's character, in his
subduing tempest of high spirits, and in the person of the foiled
revoltress against the law of sex, who carries into her wifely loyalty
the same energy which she had shown in her virgin <i>sauvagerie</i>, there
were elements of human character in which the imagination of the poet
took delight.</p>

<p>Unless it be its own excess, however, Shakespeare's laughter
seems to fear nothing. It does not, when it has once arrived at
its full development, fear enthusiasm, or passion, or tragic
intensity; nor do these fear it. The traditions of the English
drama had favored the juxtaposition of the serious and comic:
but it was reserved for Shakespeare to make each a part of the
other; to interpenetrate tragedy with comedy, and comedy with
tragic earnestness.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="SHAKESPEARE" id="SHAKESPEARE"></a>SHAKESPEARE'S PORTRAITURE OF WOMEN</h3>
<h4>From 'Transcripts and Studies'</h4>

<p>Of all the daughters of his imagination, which did Shakespeare love
the best? Perhaps we shall not err if we say one of the latest born of
them all,&mdash;our English Imogen. And what most clearly shows us how
Shakespeare loved Imogen is this&mdash;he has given her faults, and has
made them exquisite, so that we love her better for their sake. No one
has so quick and keen a sensibility to whatever pains and to whatever
gladdens as she. To her a word is a blow; and as she is quick in her
sensibility, so she is quick in her perceptions, piercing at once
through the Queen's false show of friendship; quick in her contempt
for what is unworthy, as for all professions of love from the
clown-prince, Cloten; quick in her resentment, as when she discovers
the unjust suspicions of Posthumus. Wronged she is indeed by her
husband, but in her haste she too grows unjust; yet she is dearer to
us for the sake of this injustice, proceeding as it does from the
sensitiveness of her love. It is she, to whom a word is a blow, who
actually receives a buffet from her husband's hand; but for Imogen it
is a blessed stroke, since it is the evidence of his loyalty and zeal
on her behalf. In a moment he is forgiven, and her arms are round his
neck.</p>

<p>Shakespeare made so many perfect women unhappy that he
owed us some <i>amende</i>. And he has made that <i>amende</i> by letting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4812" id="Page_4812">[Pg 4812]</a></span>
us see one perfect woman supremely happy. Shall our last
glance at Shakespeare's plays show us Florizel at the rustic
merry-making, receiving blossoms from the hands of Perdita? or
Ferdinand and Miranda playing chess in Prospero's cave, and
winning one a king and one a queen, while the happy fathers
gaze in from the entrance of the cave? We can see a more
delightful sight than these&mdash;Imogen with her arms around the
neck of Posthumus, while she puts an edge upon her joy by the
playful challenge and mock reproach&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think that you are upon a rock, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throw me again;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and he responds&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Hang there like a fruit, my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the tree die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We shall find in all Shakespeare no more blissful creatures
than these two.</p>

<h3><a name="INTERPRETATION" id="INTERPRETATION"></a>THE INTERPRETATION OF LITERATURE</h3>
<h4>From 'Transcripts and Studies'</h4>

<p>The happiest moment in a critic's hours of study is when, seemingly by
some divination, but really as the result of patient observation and
thought, he lights upon the central motive of a great work. Then, of a
sudden, order begins to form itself from the crowd and chaos of his
impressions and ideas. There is a moving hither and thither, a
grouping or coordinating of all his recent experiences, which goes on
of its own accord; and every instant his vision becomes clearer, and
new meanings disclose themselves in what had been lifeless and
unilluminated. It seems as if he could even stand by the artist's side
and co-operate with him in the process of creating. With such a sense
of joy upon him, the critic will think it no hard task to follow the
artist to the sources from whence he drew his material,&mdash;it may be
some dull chapter in an ancient chronicle, or some gross tale of
passion by an Italian novelist,&mdash;and he will stand by and
watch with exquisite pleasure the artist handling that crude
material, and refashioning and refining it, and breathing
into it the breath of a higher life. Even the minutest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4813" id="Page_4813">[Pg 4813]</a></span>
difference of text between an author's earlier and later draft, or a
first and second edition, has now become a point not for dull
commentatorship, but a point of life, at which he may touch with his
finger the pulse of the creator in his fervor of creation.</p>

<p>From each single work of a great author we advance to his total work,
and thence to the man himself,&mdash;to the heart and brain from which
all this manifold world of wisdom and wit and passion and beauty has
proceeded. Here again, before we address ourselves to the
interpretation of the author's mind, we patiently submit ourselves to
a vast series of impressions. And in accordance with Bacon's maxim
that a prudent interrogation is the half of knowledge, it is right to
provide ourselves with a number of well-considered questions which we
may address to our author. Let us cross-examine him as students of
mental and moral science, and find replies in his written words. Are
his senses vigorous and fine? Does he see color as well as form? Does
he delight in all that appeals to the sense of hearing&mdash;the
voices of nature, and the melody and harmonies of the art of man? Thus
Wordsworth, exquisitely organized for enjoying and interpreting all
natural, and if we may so say, homeless and primitive sounds, had but
little feeling for the delights of music. Can he enrich his poetry by
gifts from the sense of smell, as did Keats; or is his nose like
Wordsworth's, an idle promontory projecting into a desert air? Has he
like Browning a vigorous pleasure in all strenuous muscular movements;
or does he like Shelley live rapturously in the finest nervous
thrills? How does he experience and interpret the feeling of sex, and
in what parts of his entire nature does that feeling find its
elevating connections and associations? What are his special
intellectual powers? Is his intellect combative or contemplative? What
are the laws which chiefly preside over the associations of his ideas?
What are the emotions which he feels most strongly? and how do his
emotions coalesce with one another? Wonder, terror, awe, love, grief,
hope, despondency, the benevolent affections, admiration, the
religious sentiment, the moral sentiment, the emotion of power,
irascible emotion, ideal emotion&mdash;how do these make themselves
felt in and through his writings? What is his feeling for the
beautiful, the sublime, the ludicrous? Is he of weak or vigorous will?
In the conflict of motives, which class of motives with him is likely
to predominate? Is he framed to believe or framed to doubt?
Is he prudent, just, temperate, or the reverse of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4814" id="Page_4814">[Pg 4814]</a></span>
these? These and such-like questions are not to be crudely and formally proposed,
but are to be used with tact; nor should the critic press for hard and
definite answers, but know how skillfully to glean its meaning from an
evasion. He is a dull cross-examiner who will invariably follow the
scheme which he has thought out and prepared beforehand, and who
cannot vary his questions to surprise or beguile the truth from an
unwilling witness. But the tact which comes from natural gift and from
experience may be well supported by something of method,&mdash;method well
hidden away from the surface and from sight.</p>

<p>This may be termed the psychological method of study. But we may also
follow a more objective method. Taking the chief themes with which
literature and art are conversant&mdash;God, external nature, humanity&mdash;we
may inquire how our author has dealt with each of these. What is his
theology, or his philosophy of the universe? By which we mean no
abstract creed or doctrine, but the tides and currents of feeling and
of faith, as well as the tendencies and conclusions of the intellect.
Under what aspect has this goodly frame of things, in whose midst we
are, revealed itself to him? How has he regarded and interpreted the
life of man? Under each of these great themes a multitude of
subordinate topics are included. And alike in this and in what we have
termed the psychological method of study, we shall gain double results
if we examine a writer's works in the order of their chronology, and
thus become acquainted with the growth and development of his powers,
and the widening and deepening of his relations with man, with
external nature, and with that Supreme Power, unknown yet well known,
of which nature and man are the manifestation. As to the study of an
artist's technical qualities, this, by virtue of the fact that he is
an artist, is of capital importance; and it may often be associated
with the study of that which his technique is employed to express and
render&mdash;the characteristics of his mind, and of the vision which he
has attained of the external universe, of humanity, and of God. Of all
our study, the last end and aim should be to ascertain how a great
writer or artist has served the life of man; to ascertain this, to
bring home to ourselves as large a portion as may be of the gain
wherewith he has enriched human life, and to render access to that
store of wisdom, passion, and power, easier and surer for others.</p>

American readers came chiefly through the good offices of his
accomplished friend "Sherlock Holmes." Dr. Doyle would prefer to be

historic romances. But he has found it useless to protest. 'The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' delighted a public which enjoys
incident, mystery, and above all that matching of the wits of a clever
man against the dumb resistance of the secrecy of inanimate things,
which results in the triumph of the human intelligence. Moreover, in
Sherlock Holmes himself the reader perceived a new character in
fiction. The inventors of the French detective story,&mdash;that ingenious
Chinese puzzle of literature,&mdash;have no such wizard as he to show. Even
Poe, past master of mystery-making, is more or less empirical in his
methods of mystery-solving.</p>

<p>But Sherlock Holmes is a true product of his time. He is an embodiment
of the scientific spirit seeing microscopically and applying itself to
construct, from material vestiges and psychologic remainders, an
unknown body of proof. From the smallest fragments he deduces the
whole structure, precisely as the great naturalists do; and so
flawless are his reasonings that a course of 'The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes' would not be bad training in a high-school class in
logic.</p>

<p>The creator of this eminent personage was born in Edinburgh in
1859, of a line of artists; his grandfather, John Doyle, having been
a famous political caricaturist, whose works, under the signature
"H. B.," were purchased at a high price by the British Museum. The
quaint signature of his father&mdash;a capital D, with a little bird
perched on top, gained him the affectionate sobriquet of "Dicky

Conan. For though he was intended for the medical profession, and
after studying in Germany had kept his terms at the Medical College
of Edinburgh University, the love of letters drove him forth in
his early twenties to try his fortunes in the literary world of London.</p>

<p>Inheriting from his artist ancestry a sense of form and color, a
faculty of constructiveness, and a vivid imagination, his studiousness
and his industry have turned his capacities into abilities. For his
romance of 'The White Company' he read more than two hundred
books, and spent on it more than two years of labor. 'Micah
Clarke' and 'The Great Shadow' involved equal wit and conscience.
In his historic fiction he has described the England of Edward III.,
of James II., and of to-day, the Scotland of George III., the France
of Edward III., of Louis XIV., and of Napoleon, and the America of
Frontenac; while, in securing this correctness of historic detail, he
has not neglected the first duty of a story-teller, which is to be
interesting.</p>

<h3><a name="HOLMES" id="HOLMES"></a>THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</h3>

<h4>From 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.' Copyright 1892, by Harper &amp;
Brothers</h4>

<p>I had called upon my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes one day in
the autumn of last year, and found him in deep conversation
with a very stout, florid-faced elderly gentleman, with fiery
red hair. With an apology for my intrusion I was about to withdraw,
when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed
the door behind me.</p>

<p>"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear
Watson," he said, cordially.</p>

<p>"I was afraid that you were engaged."</p>

<p>"So I am. Very much so."</p>

<p>"Then I can wait in the next room."</p>

<p>"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner
and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have
no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."</p>

<p>The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob
of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small,
fat-encircled eyes.</p>

<p>"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair
and putting his finger-tips together, as was his custom when in
judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4817" id="Page_4817">[Pg 4817]</a></span>
love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum
routine of every-day life. You have shown your relish for
it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and
if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many
of my own little adventures."</p>

<p>"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,"
I observed.</p>

<p>"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just
before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss
Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations
we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring
than any effort of the imagination."</p>

<p>"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."</p>

<p>"You did, doctor; but none the less you must come round to
my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on
you, until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges
me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which
promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to
for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest
and most unique things are very often connected not with the
larger but with the smaller crimes; and occasionally, indeed,
where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has
been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me
to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not;
but the course of events is certainly among the most singular
that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would
have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask
you, not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the
opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the story
makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.
As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course
of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other
similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance
I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief,
unique."</p>

<p>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of
some little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper
from the inside pocket of his great-coat. As he glanced down
the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward, and the
paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4818" id="Page_4818">[Pg 4818]</a></span>
and endeavored, after the fashion of my companion, to read the
indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our
visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British
tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy
gray shepherd's-check trousers, a not over clean black frock-coat
unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat, with a heavy
brassy Albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling
down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown
overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside
him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable
about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of
extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes's quick eye took in my occupation, and he
shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning
glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time
done manual labor, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason,
that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable
amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."</p>

<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger
upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.</p>

<p>"How in the name of good fortune did you know all that,
Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example,
that I did manual labor? It's as true as gospel, for I began as
a ship's carpenter."</p>

<p>"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size
larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the
muscles are more developed."</p>

<p>"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"</p>

<p>"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read
that; especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order,
you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."</p>

<p>"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"</p>

<p>"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny
for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"</p>

<p>"Well, but China?"</p>

<p>"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your
right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a
small study of tattoo marks, and have even contributed to the
literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4819" id="Page_4819">[Pg 4819]</a></span>
of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When in addition
I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter
becomes even more simple."</p>

<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he.
"I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see
that there was nothing in it, after all."</p>

<p>"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a
mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you
know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer
shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement,
Mr. Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have got it now," he answered, with his thick red
finger planted half-way down the column. "Here it is. This is
what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."</p>

<p>I took the paper from him, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">To the Red-Headed League</span>:&mdash;On account of the bequest of
the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now
another vacancy open, which entitles a member of the League to a
salary of &pound;4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed
men who are sound in body and mind, and above the age of twenty-one
years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock,
to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet
Street."</p></div>

<p>"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated, after I had
twice read over the extraordinary announcement.</p>

<p>Holmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit
when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't
it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and
tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which
this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make
a note, doctor, of the paper and the date."</p>

<p>"It is the Morning Chronicle of April 27th, 1890. Just two
months ago."</p>

<p>"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead: "I have a
small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the city.
It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done
more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two
assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4820" id="Page_4820">[Pg 4820]</a></span>
pay him, but that he is willing to come for half wages, so as to
learn the business."</p>

<p>"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock
Holmes.</p>

<p>"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,
either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter
assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better
himself, and earn twice what I am able to give him. But
after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an <i>employ&eacute;</i>
who comes under the full market price. It is not a common
experience among employers in this age. I don't know that
your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."</p>

<p>"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was
such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera
when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down
into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures.
That is his main fault; but on the whole, he's a good worker.
There's no vice in him."</p>

<p>"He is still with you, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple
cooking, and keeps the place clean&mdash;that's all I have in the
house, for I am a widower, and never had any family. We live
very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our
heads, and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.</p>

<p>"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks,
with this very paper in his hand, and he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'</p>

<p>"'Why that?' I asks.</p>

<p>"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of
the Red-Headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any
man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies
than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end
what to do with the money. If my hair would only change
color, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'</p>

<p>"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I
am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me
instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without
putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4821" id="Page_4821">[Pg 4821]</a></span>
know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad
of a bit of news.</p>

<p>"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-Headed
Men?' he asked, with his eyes open.</p>

<p>"'Never.'</p>

<p>"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for
one of the vacancies.'</p>

<p>"'And what are they worth?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year; but the work is
slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other
occupations.'</p>

<p>"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my
ears, for the business has not been over good for some years,
and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.</p>

<p>"'Tell me all about it,' said I.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for
yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where
you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League
was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very
peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great
sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he
had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with
instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to
men whose hair is of that color. From all I hear, it is splendid pay
and very little to do.'</p>

<p>"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men
who would apply.'</p>

<p>"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see
it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This
American had started from London when he was young, and he
wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then again, I have
heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or
dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now
if you care to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but
perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out
of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'</p>

<p>"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,
that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it
seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the
matter, I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4822" id="Page_4822">[Pg 4822]</a></span>
met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that
I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put
up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me.
He was very willing to have a holiday; so we shut the business
up, and started off for the address that was given us in the
advertisement.</p>

<p>"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
north, south, east, and west, every man who had a shade of red in his
hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet
Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a
coster's orange-barrow. I should not have thought there were so many
in the whole country as were brought together by that single
advertisement. Every shade of color they were&mdash;straw, lemon, orange,
brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but as Spaulding said, there were
not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how
many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding
would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed
and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon
the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but
we wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the
office."</p>

<p>"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked
Holmes, as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a
huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."</p>

<p>"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden
chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a
head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to
each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to
find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a
vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.
However, when our turn came, the little man was much more
favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the
door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.</p>

<p>"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'</p>

<p>"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered.
'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen
anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4823" id="Page_4823">[Pg 4823]</a></span>
one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then
suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated
me warmly on my success.</p>

<p>"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however,
I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until
I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he,
as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But
we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs
and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which
would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the
window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from
below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions, until
there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of
the manager.</p>

<p>"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself
one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.
Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'</p>

<p>"I answered that I had not.</p>

<p>"His face fell immediately.</p>

<p>"'Dear me,' he said, gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I
am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was of course for the
propagation and spread of the red-heads, as well as for their
maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a
bachelor.'</p>

<p>"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that
I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it
over for a few minutes, he said that it would be all right.</p>

<p>"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be
fatal, but we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a
head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon
your new duties?'</p>

<p>"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'
said I.</p>

<p>"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent
Spaulding. 'I shall be able to look after that for you.'</p>

<p>"'What would be the hours?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Ten to two.'</p>

<p>"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening,
Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4824" id="Page_4824">[Pg 4824]</a></span>
just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a
little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a
good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.</p>

<p>"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'</p>

<p>"'Is &pound;4 a week.'</p>

<p>"'And the work?'</p>

<p>"'Is purely nominal.'</p>

<p>"'What do you call purely nominal?'</p>

<p>"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building,
the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position
forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't
comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during
that time.'</p>

<p>"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,'
said I.</p>

<p>"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross, 'neither sickness
nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or
you lose your billet.'</p>

<p>"'And the work?'</p>

<p>"'Is to copy out the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica. There is the
first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink,
pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair.
Will you be ready to-morrow?'</p>

<p>"'Certainly,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'Then good-by, Mr. Jabez Wilson; and let me congratulate
you once more on the important position which you have been
fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room, and
I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or
do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I
was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that
the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what
its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether
past belief that any one could make such a will, or that they
would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying
out the 'Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what
he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself
out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined
to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink,
and with a quill pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper I started
off for Pope's Court.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4825" id="Page_4825">[Pg 4825]</a></span>
"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as
possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan
Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me
off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop
in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two
o'clock he bade me good-by, complimented me upon the amount
that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.</p>

<p>"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday
the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns
for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same
the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every
afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to
coming in only once of a morning, and then after a time he
did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave
the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that
I would not risk the loss of it.</p>

<p>"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about
Abbots and Archery and Armor and Architecture and Attica, and
hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very
long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly
filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole
business came to an end."</p>

<p>"To an end?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my
work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked
with a little square of card-board hammered on to the middle of
the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."</p>

<p>He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a
sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="char">
<span class="smcap">The Red-Headed League</span><br />
<span class="smcap">is</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Dissolved</span>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 50%;"><i>October 9th, 1890.</i></span></p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and
the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so
completely overtopped every other consideration that we both
burst out into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4826" id="Page_4826">[Pg 4826]</a></span>
"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our
client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can
do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from
which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for
the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
Pray, what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
door?"</p>

<p>"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-Headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'</p>

<p>"'What, the red-headed man?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris.  He was a
solicitor, and was using my room as a temporary convenience
until his new premises were ready.  He moved out yesterday.'</p>

<p>"'Where could I find him?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes,
17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'</p>

<p>"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it
was a manufactory of artificial knee caps, and no one in it had
ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."</p>

<p>"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.</p>

<p>"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice
of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He
could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that
was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose
such a place without a struggle; so as I had heard that you
were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need
of it, I came right away to you."</p>

<p>"And you did very wisely." said Holmes. "Your case is an
exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
From what you have told me, I think that it is possible that
graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4827" id="Page_4827">[Pg 4827]</a></span>
"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost
four pound a week."</p>

<p>"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes,
"I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary
league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer
by some &pound;30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you
have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A.
You have lost nothing by them."</p>

<p>"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they
are, and what their object was in playing this prank&mdash;if it was
a prank&mdash;upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them,
for it cost them two-and-thirty pounds."</p>

<p>"We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And
first one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours
who first called your attention to the advertisement&mdash;how long
had he been with you?"</p>

<p>"About a month then."</p>

<p>"How did he come?"</p>

<p>"In answer to an advertisement."</p>

<p>"Was he the only applicant?"</p>

<p>"No; I had a dozen."</p>

<p>"Why did you pick him?"</p>

<p>"Because he was handy, and would come cheap."</p>

<p>"At half wages, in fact."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"</p>

<p>"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his
face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid
upon his forehead."</p>

<p>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I
thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his
ears are pierced for earrings?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him
when he was a lad."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is
still with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir; I have only just left him."</p>

<p>"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do
of a morning."</p>

<p>"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4828" id="Page_4828">[Pg 4828]</a></span>
is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."</p>

<p>"Well, Watson," said Holmes, when our visitor had left us,
"what do you make of it all?"</p>

<p>"I make nothing of it," I answered, frankly. "It is a most
mysterious business."</p>

<p>"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is, the
less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless
crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face
is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this
matter."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three-pipe problem,
and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He
curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to
his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and
indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his
chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind, and
put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he
remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients
spare you for a few hours?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very
absorbing."</p>

<p>"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the
city first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe
that there is a good deal of German music on the programme,
which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is
introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"</p>

<p>We traveled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a
short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the
singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was
a poky little shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied
brick houses looked out into a small railed-in inclosure,
where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes
made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial
atmosphere. Three gilt balls, and a brown board with
"<span class="smcap">Jabez Wilson</span>" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced
the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it, with his head on one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4829" id="Page_4829">[Pg 4829]</a></span>
side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between
puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and
then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses.
Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and having thumped
vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened
by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him
to step in.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wish to ask you how you
would go from here to the Strand."</p>

<p>"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant, promptly,
closing the door.</p>

<p>"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes, as we walked away.
"He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London,
and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be
third. I have known something of him before."</p>

<p>"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good
deal in this mystery of the Red-Headed League. I am sure that
you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."</p>

<p>"Not him."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"The knees of his trousers."</p>

<p>"And what did you see?"</p>

<p>"What I expected to see."</p>

<p>"Why did you beat the pavement?"</p>

<p>"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.
We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of
Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie
behind it."</p>

<p>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a
contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was
one of the main arteries which convey the traffic of the city to
the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense
stream of commerce, flowing in a double tide inward and
outward, while the foot-paths were black with the hurrying
swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize, as we looked at
the line of fine shops and stately business premises, that they
really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant
square which we had just quitted.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing
along the line, "I should like just to remember the order
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4830" id="Page_4830">[Pg 4830]</a></span>
of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.
There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the
Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian
Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us
right on to the other block. And now, doctor, we've done our work, so
it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then
off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony,
and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."</p>

<p>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not
only a very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary
merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the
most perfect happiness, gently waving his long thin fingers in
time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid,
dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound,
Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent,
as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual
nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and
astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction
against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
extreme languor to devouring energy; and as I knew well, he
was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had
been lounging in his arm-chair, amid his improvisations and his
black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase
would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning
power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were
unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on
a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I
saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's
Hall, I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom
he had set himself to hunt down.</p>

<p>"You want to go home, no doubt, doctor," he remarked as
we emerged.</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be as well."</p>

<p>"And I have some business to do which will take some hours.
This business at Coburg Square is serious."</p>

<p>"Why serious?"</p>

<p>"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason
to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day
being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your
help to-night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4831" id="Page_4831">[Pg 4831]</a></span>
"At what time?"</p>

<p>"Ten will be early enough."</p>

<p>"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."</p>

<p>"Very well. And I say, doctor, there may be some little
danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He
waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant
among the crowd.</p>

<p>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I
was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my
dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had
heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it
was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened,
but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business
was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house
in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story
of the red-headed copier of the 'Encyclop&aelig;dia' down to the
visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which
he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and
why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were
we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced
pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man&mdash;a man who might
play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in
despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an
explanation.</p>

<p>It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and
made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to
Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as
I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above.
On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation
with two men, one of whom I recognized as Peter Jones, the
official police agent, while the other was a long thin sad-faced
man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.</p>

<p>"Ha! our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his
pea-jacket, and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let
me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion
in to-night's adventure."</p>

<p>"We're hunting in couples again, doctor, you see," said Jones,
in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man
for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to
do the running down."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4832" id="Page_4832">[Pg 4832]</a></span>
"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our
chase," observed Mr. Merryweather, gloomily.</p>

<p>"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,"
said the police agent, loftily. "He has his own little methods,
which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical
and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in
him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that
business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has
been more nearly correct than the official force."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the
stranger, with deference, "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
that I have not had my rubber."</p>

<p>"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for
a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play
will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be
some &pound;30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you
wish to lay your hands."</p>

<p>"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young
man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I
would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.
He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal
duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as
cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn,
we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in
Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in
Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years, and have never
set eyes on him yet."</p>

<p>"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've
had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with
you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,
and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,
Watson and I will follow in the second."</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive, and
lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the
afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
until we emerged into Farringdon Street.</p>

<p>"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow
Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4833" id="Page_4833">[Pg 4833]</a></span>
matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a
bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one
positive virtue. He is as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a
lobster if he gets his claws upon any one. Here we are, and they are
waiting for us."</p>

<p>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found
ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and following the
guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and
through a side door, which he opened for us. Within, there was a small
corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was
opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated
at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a
lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage,
and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which
was piled all around with crates and massive boxes.</p>

<p>"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked, as he held
up the lantern and gazed about him.</p>

<p>"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the
flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"
he remarked, looking up in surprise.</p>

<p>"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet," said Holmes,
severely. "You have already imperiled the whole success of our
expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down
upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"</p>

<p>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very
injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees
upon the floor, and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to
examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed
to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in
his pocket.</p>

<p>"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked; "for they can
hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then
they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the
longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,
doctor&mdash;as no doubt you have divined&mdash;in the cellar at the City branch
of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman
of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why
the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable
interest in this cellar at present."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4834" id="Page_4834">[Pg 4834]</a></span>
"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several
warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."</p>

<p>"Your French gold?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our
resources, and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from
the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never
had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in
our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons
packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is
much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch
office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."</p>

<p>"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And
now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that
within an hour matters will come to a head. In the mean time,
Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark
lantern."</p>

<p>"And sit in the dark?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket,
and I thought that, as we were a <i>partie carr&eacute;e</i>, you might have
your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations
have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light.
And first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring
men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they
may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand
behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those.
Then when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they
fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."</p>

<p>I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind
which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his
lantern, and left us in pitch darkness&mdash;such an absolute darkness as I
had never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to
assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a
moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of
expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden
gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.</p>

<p>"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through
the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I
asked you, Jones?"</p>

<p>"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4835" id="Page_4835">[Pg 4835]</a></span>
"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be
silent and wait."</p>

<p>What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it
was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the
night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above
us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my
position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of
tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear
the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish
the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin,
sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could
look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my
eyes caught the glint of a light.</p>

<p>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement.
Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,
without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a
hand appeared; a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about
in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more
the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor.
Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was
dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink
between the stones.</p>

<p>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a
rending, tearing sound, one of the broad white stones turned
over upon its side, and left a square gaping hole, through which
streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a
clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then,
with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high
and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In
another instant he stood at the side of the hole, and was hauling
after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale
face and a shock of very red hair.</p>

<p>"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and
the bags?&mdash;Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing
for it!"</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by
the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the
sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light
flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes's hunting crop
came down on the man's wrist and the pistol clinked upon the
stone floor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4836" id="Page_4836">[Pg 4836]</a></span>
"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes, blandly, "You have
no chance at all."</p>

<p>"So I see," the other answered, with the utmost coolness.
"I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his
coat-tails."</p>

<p>"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said
Holmes.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely.
I must compliment you."</p>

<p>"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was
very new and effective."</p>

<p>"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's
quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out, while
I fix the derbies."</p>

<p>"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
remarked our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins.
Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say
'sir' and 'please.'"</p>

<p>"All right," said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. "Well,
would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab
to carry your Highness to the police station?"</p>

<p>"That is better," said John Clay, serenely. He made a
sweeping bow to the three of us, and walked quietly off in the
custody of the detective.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from
the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.
There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most
complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
that have ever come within my experience."</p>

<p>"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John
Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this
matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund; but beyond that I am
amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,
and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-Headed
League."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"You see, Watson," he explained, in the early hours of the
morning, as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker
Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4837" id="Page_4837">[Pg 4837]</a></span>
possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League,
and the copying of the 'Encyclop&aelig;dia,' must be to get this not over bright
pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a
curious way of managing it, but really, it would be difficult to
suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's
ingenious mind by the color of his accomplice's hair. The &pound;4 a week
was a lure which must draw him,&mdash;and what was it to them, who were
playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has
the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it,
and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half
wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for
securing the situation."</p>

<p>"But how could you guess what the motive was?"</p>

<p>"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere
vulgar intrigue. That however was out of the question. The man's
business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which
could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure
as they were at. It must then be something out of the house. What
could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography,
and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the
end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious
assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and
most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the
cellar&mdash;something which took many hours a day for months on end. What
could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was
running a tunnel to some other building.</p>

<p>"So, far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action.
I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I
was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or
behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and as I
hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes,
but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly
looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You
must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained
they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only
remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked
round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4838" id="Page_4838">[Pg 4838]</a></span>
on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.
When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland
Yard, and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the
result that you have seen."</p>

<p>"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
to-night?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, when they closed their League offices, that was a sign that
they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence&mdash;in other
words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that
they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion
might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day,
as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons
I expected them to come to-night."</p>

<p>"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed, in unfeigned
admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings
true."</p>

<p>"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I
already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long
effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
problems help me to do so."</p>

<p>"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps after all it is of
some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien&mdash;l'&#339;uvre
c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."</p>

<p>Danish literature had stood high during the first half of the nineteenth
century. In 1850 Oehlenschl&auml;ger died. In 1870 there was practically
no Danish literature. The reason for this may have been that
after the new political life of 1848-9 and the granting of the Danish
Constitution, politics absorbed all young talent, and men of literary
tastes put themselves at the service of the daily press.</p>

<p>In 1872 Georg Brandes gave his lectures on 'Main Currents in the
Literature of the Nineteenth Century' at the University of Copenhagen.
That same year Drachmann published his first collection of 'Poems,'
and so began his extraordinary productivity of poems, dramas, and
novels. Of these, his lyric poems are undoubtedly of the greatest
value. His is a distinctly lyric temperament. The new school had
chosen for its guide Brandes's teaching that "Literature, to be of
significance, should discuss problems." In view of this fact it is
somewhat hard to understand why Drachmann should be called a man of
the new era. He never discusses problems. He always gives himself up
unreservedly to the subject which at that special moment claims his
sympathy. Taken as a whole, therefore, his writings present a certain
inconsistency. He has shown himself alternately as socialist and
royalist, realist and romanticist, freethinker and believer,
cosmopolitan and national, according to the lyric enthusiasm of the
moment. Independent of these changes, the one thing to be admired and
enjoyed is his lyric feeling and the often exquisite form in which he
presents it. His larger compositions, novels, and dramas do not show
the same power over his subject.</p>

<p>If Drachmann discusses any problem, it is the problem Drachmann.
He does this sometimes with what Brandes calls "a light and joking
self-irony," in a most sympathetic way. Brandes quotes one of Drachmann's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4841" id="Page_4841">[Pg 4841]</a></span>
early stories, where it is said of the hero:&mdash;"His name was
really Palnatoke Olsen; a continually repeated discord of two tones,
as he used to say." Olsen is one of the most commonplace Danish
names. Palnatoke is the name of one of the fiercest warriors of
heathen antiquity, who, like a veritable Valhalla god, dared to oppose
the terrible Danish king Harald Blaatand. When Olsen's parents
gave him this name they unwittingly described their son, "forever
drawn by two poles: one the plain Olsen, the other the hot-headed
fiery Viking." With this in mind, and considering Drachmann's literary
works as a whole, one is irresistibly reminded of his friend and
contemporary in Norway, Bj&ouml;rnsterne Bj&ouml;rnson. There is this difference
between them, however, that if the irony of Palnatoke Olsen
may be applied to both, one might for Drachmann use the abbreviation
P. Olsen and for Bj&ouml;rnson undoubtedly Palnatoke O.</p>

<p>It might be said of Drachmann, as Sauer said of the Italian poet
Monti:&mdash;"Like a master in the art of appreciation, he knew how to
give himself up to great time-stirring ideas; somewhat as a gifted
actor throws himself into his part, with the full strength of his art,
with an enthusiasm carrying all before it, and in the most expressive
way; then when the part is played, lays it quietly aside and takes
hold of something else."</p>

<p>When a young man, Drachmann studied at the Academy of Arts in
Copenhagen, and met with considerable success as a marine painter.
His love for the Northern seas shows itself in his poetry and prose,
and his descriptions of the sea and the life of the sailor and fisherman
are of the truest and best yielded by his pen. He is the author
of no less than forty-six volumes of poems, dramas, novels, short
stories, and sketches, and of two unpublished dramas. His most important
work is 'Forskrevet' (Condemned), which is largely autobiographical;
his most attractive though not his strongest production is
the opera 'Der Var Engang' (Once Upon a Time), founded on
Andersen's 'The Swineherd,' with music by Sange M&uuml;ller; his best
poems and tales are those dealing with the sea.</p>

<p>At present he lives in Hamburg, where on October 10th, 1896, he
celebrated his fiftieth birthday and his twenty-fifth "Author-Jubilee,"
as the Danes call it. Among the features of the celebration were
the sending of an enormous number of telegrams from Drachmann's
admirers in Europe and America, and the performance of two of his
plays,&mdash;one at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, the other at the
Stadt Theatre in Altona.</p>

<h3><a name="SKIPPER" id="SKIPPER"></a>THE SKIPPER AND HIS SHIP</h3>

<h4>From 'Paul and Virginia of a Northern Zone': copyright 1895, by Way and
Williams, Chicago</h4>


<p>The Anna Dorothea, in the North Sea, was pounding along
under shortened sail. The weather was thick, the air dense;
there was a falling barometer.</p>

<p>It had been a short trip this time. Leroy and Sons, wine merchants of
Havre, had made better offers than the old houses in Bordeaux. At each
one of his later trips, Captain Spang had said it should be his last.
He would "lay up" at home; he was growing too stout and clumsy for the
sea, and now he must trust fully to T&ouml;nnes, his first mate. The
captain's big broad face was flushed as usual; he always looked as if
he were illuminated by a setting October sun; there was no change
here&mdash;rather, the sunset tint was stronger. But T&ouml;nnes noted how the
features, which he knew best in moments of simple good-nature and of
sullen tumult, had gradually relaxed. He thought that it would indeed
soon be time for his old skipper to "lay up"; yet perhaps a few trips
might still be made.</p>

<p>"Holloa, T&ouml;nnes! let her go about before the next squall
strikes her. She lies too dead on this bow."</p>

<p>The skipper had raised his head above the cabin stairs. As
usual, he was in his shirt-sleeves, and his scanty hair fluttered in
the wind. When he had warned his mate, he again disappeared
in the cabin.</p>

<p>T&ouml;nnes gave the order to the man at the helm, and hurried
to help at the main-braces. The double-reefed main-topsail swung
about, the Anna Dorothea caught the wind somewhat sluggishly,
and not without getting considerable water over her; then followed
the fore-topsail, the reefed foresail, and the trysail. When
the tacking was finished and the sails had again caught the
wind, the trysail was torn from the boltropes with a loud crack.</p>

<p>The captain's head appeared again,</p>

<p>"We must close-reef!" said he.</p>

<p>The last reef was taken in; the storm came down and lashed
the sea; the sky grew more and more threatening; the waves
dashed over the deck at each plunge of the old bark in the sea.
The old vessel, which had carried her captain for a generation,
lay heavily on the water&mdash;T&ouml;nnes thought too heavily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4843" id="Page_4843">[Pg 4843]</a></span>
The second mate&mdash;the same who had played the accordion at
the inn&mdash;came over to T&ouml;nnes.</p>

<p>"It was wrong to stow the china-clay at the bottom and the
casks on top; she lies horribly dead, and I'm afraid we shall have
to use the pumps."</p>

<p>"Yes, I said so to the old man, but he would have it that
way," answered T&ouml;nnes. "We shall have a wet night."</p>

<p>"We shall, surely," said the second mate.</p>

<p>T&ouml;nnes crawled up to the helm and looked at the compass.
Two men were at the helm&mdash;lashed fast. T&ouml;nnes looked up
into the rigging and out to windward; then suddenly he cried,
with the full force of his lungs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look out for breakers!"</p>

<p>T&ouml;nnes himself helped at the wheel; but the vessel only half
answered the helm. The greater portion of the sea struck the
bow, the quarter, and the bulwarks and stanchions amidship, so
that they creaked and groaned. One of the men at the helm had
grasped T&ouml;nnes, who would otherwise have been swept into the
lee scupper. When the ship had righted from the terrible blow,
the captain stood on the deck in his oilcloth suit.</p>

<p>"Are any men missing?" cried he, through the howling of
the wind and the roaring of the water streaming fore and aft,
unable to escape quickly enough through the scuppers.</p>

<p>The storm raged with undiminished fury. The crew&mdash;and amongst them
Prussian, who had been promoted to be ship's-dog&mdash;by-and-by dived
forward through the seething salt water and the fragments of wreck
that covered the deck.</p>

<p>Now it was that the second mate was missing.</p>

<p>The captain looked at T&ouml;nnes, and then out on the wild sea.
He scarcely glanced at the crushed long-boat; even if a boat
could have been launched, it would have been too late. T&ouml;nnes
and his skipper were fearless men, who took things as they were.
If any help could have been given, they would have given it.
But their eyes sought vainly for any dark speck amidst the
foaming waves&mdash;and it was necessary to care for themselves,
the vessel and the crew.</p>

<p>"God save his soul!" murmured Captain Spang.</p>

<p>T&ouml;nnes passed his hand across his brow, and went to his duty.
Evening set in; the wind increased rather than decreased.</p>

<p>"She is taking in water," said the captain, who had sounded
the pumps.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4844" id="Page_4844">[Pg 4844]</a></span>
T&ouml;nnes assented.</p>

<p>"We must change her course," said the captain. "She
pitches too heavily in this sea."</p>

<p>The bark was held up to the wind as closely as possible.
The pumps were worked steadily, but often got out of order on
account of the china-clay, which mixed with the water down in
the hold.</p>

<p>It was plain that the vessel grew heavier and heavier; her
movements in climbing a wave were more and more dead.</p>

<p>During the night a cry arose: again one of the crew was
washed overboard.</p>

<p>It was a long night and a wet one, as T&ouml;nnes had predicted.
Several times the skipper dived clown into the cabin&mdash;Tonnes
knew perfectly well what for, but he said nothing. Few words
were spoken on board the Anna Dorothea that night.</p>

<p>In the morning the captain, returning from one of his excursions
down below, declared that the cabin was half full of water.</p>

<p>"We must watch for a sail," he said, abruptly and somewhat
huskily.</p>

<p>T&ouml;nnes passed the word round amongst the crew. One might
read on their faces that they were prepared for this, and that
they had ceased to hope, although they had not stopped work at
the pumps.</p>

<p>The whole of the weather bulwark, the cook's cabin and the
long-boat, were crushed or washed away; the water could be
heard below the hatches. While keeping a sharp lookout for
sails, many an eye glanced at the yawl as the last resort. But
on board Captain Spang's vessel the words were not yet spoken
which carried with them the doom of the ship: "We are sinking!"</p>

<p>In the gray-white of the dawn a signal was to be hoisted; the
bunting was tied together at the middle and raised half-mast high.</p>

<p>Both the captain and T&ouml;nnes had lashed themselves aft; for
now the bark was but little better than a wreck, over which the
billows broke incessantly, as the vessel, reeling like a drunken
man, exposed herself to the violent attacks of the sea instead of
parrying them.</p>

<p>"A sail to windward, captain!" cried T&ouml;nnes.</p>

<p>Captain Spang only nodded.</p>

<p>"She holds her course!" cried one of the crew excitedly.
"No," said T&ouml;nnes, quietly. "She has seen us, and is bearing
down upon us!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4845" id="Page_4845">[Pg 4845]</a></span>
The captain again nodded.</p>

<p>"Tis a brig!" cried one of the crew.</p>

<p>"A schooner-brig!" T&ouml;nnes corrected. "She carries her sails
finely. I am sure she is a fruit-trader."</p>

<p>At last the strange vessel was so near that they could see her
deck each time she was thrown upon her side in the violent
seething sea.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'tis the schooner-brig!" exclaimed T&ouml;nnes. "Do you
remember, captain, the time when&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Captain Spang nodded. He acted strangely. T&ouml;nnes
looked sharply at him, and shook his head.</p>

<p>Now T&ouml;nnes hailed the vessel:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Help us!&mdash;We are sinking!"</p>

<p>At this moment two or three of the bark's crew rushed toward
the yawl, although T&ouml;nnes warned them back.</p>

<p>Captain Spang seemed changed. Evidently some opposing
feelings contended within him. Seeing the insubordination of the
men, he only shrugged his shoulders, and let T&ouml;nnes take full
charge.</p>

<p>The men were in the yawl, still hanging under the iron
davits. Now they cut the ropes; the yawl touched the water.
The crew of the other vessel gestured warningly; but it was too
late. A sea seized the yawl with its small crew, and the next
moment crushed it against the main chains of the bark. Their
shipmates raised a cry, and rushed to help them; but help was
impossible. Boat and crew had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Didn't I say so?" cried T&ouml;nnes, with flaming eyes.</p>

<p>Over there in the schooner-brig all was activity. From the Anna
Dorothea they could plainly see how the captain gave his orders. He
manoeuvred his vessel like a true sailor. To board the wreck in such a
sea would be madness. Therefore they unreeved two long lines and
attached them to the long-boat, one on each side. Then they laid
breeching under the boat, and hauled it up amidships by means of
tackle. Taking advantage of a moment when their vessel was athwart the
seas, they unloosed the tackle, and the boat swung out over the side;
then they cut the breeching, the boat fell on the water aft, and now
both lines were eased off quickly; while the brig caught the wind, the
boat drifted toward the stern-sheets of the bark.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4846" id="Page_4846">[Pg 4846]</a></span></p><p>T&ouml;nnes was ready with a boat-hook, and connections were quickly made
between the boat and the wreck.</p>

<p>"Quick now!" cried T&ouml;nnes. "Every man in the boat. No
one takes his clothes with him! We may be thankful if we save
our lives."</p>

<p>The men were quickly over the stern-sheets and down in the
boat. Prussian whined, and kept close to Captain Spang, who
had not moved one step on the deck.</p>

<p>"Come, captain!" cried T&ouml;nnes, taking the skipper by the
arm.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the old man angrily.</p>

<p>T&ouml;nnes looked at him. Prussian barked.</p>

<p>"We must get into the boat, captain. The vessel may sink
at any moment. Come!"</p>

<p>The captain pressed his sou'wester down over his forehead,
and glanced around his deck.</p>

<p>The men in the boat cried out to them to come.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Captain Spang, but with an air so absent-minded and a
bearing so irresolute that T&ouml;nnes at last took a firm hold on him.</p>

<p>Prussian showed his teeth at his former master.</p>

<p>"You go first!" exclaimed T&ouml;nnes, snatching the dog and
throwing him down to the men, who were having hard work to
keep the boat from wrecking.</p>

<p>When the dog was no longer on the deck, it seemed as if
Captain Spang's resistance was broken. T&ouml;nnes did not let go
his hold on him; but the young mate had to use almost superhuman
strength to get the heavy old man down over the vessel's
side and placed on a seat in the boat.</p>

<p>As soon as they had observed from the brig that this had
been done, they hauled in both lines. The boat moved back
again; but it was a dangerous voyage, and all were obliged to
lash themselves fast to the thwarts with ropes placed there for
that purpose.</p>

<p>Captain Spang was like a child. T&ouml;nnes had to lash him to
the seat. The old man sat with his face hidden in his hands,
his back turned toward his ship, inactive, and seemingly unconscious
of what took place around him.</p>

<p>At last, when after a hard struggle all were on the deck of
the schooner-brig, her captain came forward, placed his hand on
his old friend's shoulder, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the second time, you see! Well, we all cling to life,
and the vessel over there is pretty old."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4847" id="Page_4847">[Pg 4847]</a></span>
Captain Spang started. He scarcely returned his friend's
hand-shaking.</p>

<p>"My vessel, I say! My papers! All that I have is in the
vessel. I must go aboard, do you hear? I must go aboard.
How could I forget?"</p>

<p>The other skipper and T&ouml;nnes looked at each other.</p>

<p>Captain Spang wrung his hands and stamped on the deck, his
eyes fixed on his sinking vessel. She was still afloat; what did
he care for the gale and the heavy sea? He belonged to the old
school of skippers; he was bound to his vessel by ties longer
than any life-line, heavier than any hawser: he had left his ship
in a bewildered state, and had taken nothing with him that
might serve to prove what he possessed and how long he had
possessed it. His good old vessel was still floating on the water.
He must, he would go there; if nobody would go with him, he
would go alone.</p>

<p>All remonstrances were in vain.</p>

<p>T&ouml;nnes pressed the other skipper's hand.</p>

<p>"There is nothing else to be done. I know him," said he.</p>

<p>"So do I," was the answer.</p>

<p>Captain Spang and his mate were again in the boat. As they
were on the point of starting, a loud whine and violent barking
sounded from the deck, and Prussian showed his one eye over
the railing.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are!" cried T&ouml;nnes. "We shall be back
soon."</p>

<p>But the dog did not understand him. Perhaps he had his
doubts; no one can say. He sprang overboard; T&ouml;nnes seized
him by the ear, and hauled him into the boat.</p>

<p>And then the two men and the dog ventured back to the
abandoned vessel.</p>

<p>This time the old man climbed on board without assistance.</p>

<p>Prussian whined in the boat.</p>

<p>"Throw that dog up to me!" cried the master.</p>

<p>T&ouml;nnes did so.</p>

<p>"Shall I come up and help you?" he called out.</p>

<p>"No, I can find my own way."</p>

<p>"But hurry, captain! do you understand?" said T&ouml;nnes, who
anxiously noticed that the motions of the vessel were becoming
more and more dangerous, while he needed all his strength to
keep the boat clear of the wreck.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4848" id="Page_4848">[Pg 4848]</a></span>
An answer came from the bark, but he could not catch it.
In this moment T&ouml;nnes recalled the day when he rowed the
captain out on the bay to the brig.  His next thought was of
Nanna. Oh, if she knew where they were!</p>

<p>And at this thought the mate's breast was filled with conflicting
emotions.  The dear blessed girl! Oh, if her father would
only come!</p>

<p>"Captain!" cried T&ouml;nnes; "Captain Spang! for God's sake,
come!  Leave those papers alone.  The vessel is sinking.  We
may at any moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>The captain stood at the stern-sheets. At his side was Prussian,
squinting down into the boat. There was an entirely strange expression
in Andreas Spang's face; a double expression&mdash;one moment hard and
defiant, the next almost solemn.</p>

<p>The sou'wester had fallen from his old head. His scanty hairs
fluttered in the wind. He held in his hand a parcel of papers and a
coil of rope. He pointed toward the brig.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried, throwing the package and the rope down to Tonnes.
"Give the skipper this new line for his trouble. He has used plenty of
rope for us. You go back. I stay here. Give&mdash;my&mdash;love&mdash;to the girl at
home.&mdash;You and she&mdash;You two&mdash;God bless you!"</p>

<p>"Captain!" cried T&ouml;nnes in affright; "you are sick; come, let me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He prepared to climb on board.</p>

<p>Captain Spang lifted his hand threateningly, and Prussian
barked furiously.</p>

<p>"Stay down there, boy, I say!  The vessel and I, we belong
together.  You shall take care of the girl.  Good-by!"</p>

<p>The Anna Dorothea rolled heavily over on one side, righted
again, and then began to plunge her head downwards, like a
whale that, tired of the surface, seeks rest at the bottom. The
crew of the brig hauled in the lines of the boat.  Tossed on the
turbid sea, T&ouml;nnes saw his old skipper leaning against the helm,
the dog at his side.  His gray hairs fluttered in the wind as
if they wafted a last farewell; and down with vessel and dog
went the old skipper&mdash;down into the wild sea that so long had
borne him on its waves.</p>

<h2><a name="JOSEPH_RODMAN_DRAKE" id="JOSEPH_RODMAN_DRAKE"></a>JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE</h2>
<h4>(1795-1820)</h4>

</div><p class="dropcap">onspicuous among the young poets, essayists, and journalists, who
made up literary New York in the early part of the century, was Joseph
Rodman Drake, the friend of Halleck, and the best beloved perhaps of
all that brilliant group. Hardly known to this generation save by
'The Culprit Fay' and 'The American Flag,' Drake was essentially a
true poet and a man of letters. His work was characteristic of his
day. He had a certain amount of classical knowledge, a certain
eighteenth-century grace and style, yet withal, an instinctive
Americanism which flowered out into our first true national
literature. The group of writers among whom were found Irving,
Halleck, Willis, Dana, Hoffman, Verplanck, Brockden Brown, and a
score of others, reflected that age in which they sought their
literary models. With the exception of Poe, who belonged to a somewhat
later time and whose genius was purely subjective, much of the
production of these Americans followed the lines of their English
predecessors,&mdash;Johnson, Goldsmith, Addison, and Steele. It is only in
their deeper moments of thought and feeling that there sounds that
note of love of country, of genuine Americanism, which gives their
work individuality, and which will keep their memory green.</p>

<p>Drake was born in New York, in August 1795.  He was descended
from the same family as the great admiral of Elizabethan days, the
American branch of which had served their country honorably both
in colonial and Revolutionary times.  The scenes of his boyhood
were the same as those that formed the environment of Irving,
memories of which are scattered thick through the literature of the
day.  New York was still a picturesque, hospitable, rural capital, the
centre of the present town being miles distant in the country.  The
best families were all intimately associated in a social life that was
cultivated and refined at the same time that it was gay and unconventional;
and in this society Drake occupied a place which his lovable
qualities and fine talents must have won, even had it been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4852" id="Page_4852">[Pg 4852]</a></span>
denied him by birth.  He was a precocious boy, for whom a career
was anticipated by his friends while he was yet a mere child; and
when he met Halleck, in his eighteenth year, he had already won
some reputation.</p>

<p>The friendship of Drake and Halleck was destined to prove infinitely
valuable to both.  A discussion between Cooper, Halleck, and
Drake, upon the poetic inspiration of American scenery, prompted
Drake to write 'The Culprit Fay'&mdash;a poem without any human
character.  This he completed in three days, and offered it as the
argument on his side.  The scene of the poem is laid in the Highlands
of the Hudson, but Drake added many pictures suggested by
memories of Long Island Sound, whose waters he haunted with boat
and rod.  He apologized for this by saying that the purposes of poetry
alone could explain the presence so far up the Hudson of so many
salt-water emigrants.  'The Culprit Fay' is a creation of pure fancy,
full of delicate imagery, and handled with an ethereal lightness of
touch.  Its exquisite grace, its delicate coloring, its prodigality of
charm, explain its immediate popularity and its lasting fame.  But
the Rip Van Winkle legend is a far more genuine product of fancy.</p>

<p>Drake's few shorter lyrics throb with genuine poetic feeling, and
show the loss sustained by literature in the author's early death.
Best known of these is 'The American Flag,' which appeared in the
Evening Post as one of a series of <i>jeux d'esprit</i>, the joint productions
of Halleck and Drake, who either alternated in the composition of
the numbers or wrote them together.  The last four lines only of
'The American Flag' are Halleck's.  The entire series appeared between
March and July, 1819, under the signature of "The Croakers."
Literary New York was mystified as to the authorship of these skits,
which hit off the popular fads, follies, and enthusiasms of the day
with so easy and graceful a touch.  Politics, music, the drama, and
domestic life alike furnished inspiration for the numbers; some of
whose titles, as 'A Sketch of a Debate in Tammany' and 'The
Battery War,' suggest the local political issues of the present day.
There is now in existence a handsome edition of these verses, with
the names of the authors of the several pieces appended, and in the
case of the joint ownership with the initials D. and H. subscribed.</p>

<p>Drake's complete poems were not published during his lifetime.
Sixteen years after his death by consumption in his twenty-sixth
year, his daughter issued a volume dedicated to Halleck, in which
were included the best specimens of her father's work.  Many of the
lesser known verses indicate his true place as a poet.  In the touching
poem 'Abelard to Eloise,' in the third stanza of 'The American
Flag,' and in innumerable beautiful lines scattered throughout his
work, appears a genuine inspiration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4853" id="Page_4853">[Pg 4853]</a></span>
In his own day, Drake filled a place which his death left forever
vacant. His rare and winning personality, his generous friendships,
his joy in life, and his courage in the contemplation of his inevitable
fate, still appeal to a generation to whom they are but traditions.
The exquisite monody in which Halleck celebrated his loss, links their
names and decorates their friendship with imperishable garlands.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he subject of this sketch was born at St. Helen's, near Liverpool,
England, on the 5th of May, 1811. His earliest education was obtained
at a Wesleyan Methodist school, but after a time he came under private
teachers, with whose help he made rapid progress in the physical
sciences, thus showing in his boyhood the natural bent of his mind and
the real strength of his intellect. He afterwards studied for a time
at the University of London, but in 1833 came to the United States,
and three years later graduated at the University of Pennsylvania with
the degree of M. D. In 1839 he was elected to the chair of chemistry
in the University of New York, a position which he held until his
death in 1882.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">John William Draper</span></span>
</div>

<p>Draper's contributions to science were of a high order. He discovered
some of the facts that lie at the basis of spectrum analysis; he was
one of the first successful experimenters in the art of photography;
and he made researches in radiant energy and other scientific
phenomena. He published in 1858 a treatise on 'Human Physiology,'
which is a highly esteemed and widely used text-book. He died on the
4th of January, 1882.</p>

<p>Draper's chief contributions to literature are three works: 'History
of the Intellectual Development of Europe' (1863), a 'History of the
American Civil War' (1867-1870), and 'The History of the Conflict
between Religion and Science,' which appeared in the International
Scientific Series in 1873. Of these works, the one on the intellectual
development of Europe is the ablest, and takes a place beside the
works of Lecky and Buckle as a contribution to the history of
civilization. The history of the Civil War was written too soon after
the events described to have permanent historical value. 'The History
of the Conflict between Religion and Science' is a judicial
presentation of the perennial controversy from the standpoint of the
scientist.</p>

<p>Draper's claims to attention as a philosophic historian rest mainly
on his theory of the influence of climate on human character and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4866" id="Page_4866">[Pg 4866]</a></span>
development. He maintains that "For every climate, and indeed for
every geographical locality, there is an answering type of humanity";
and in his history of the American Civil War, as well as in his work
on the intellectual development of Europe, he endeavored to prove
that doctrine.  Another theory which is prominent in his principal
work is, that the intellectual development of every people passes
through five stages; namely, 1, the Age of Credulity; 2, the Age of
Inquiry; 3, the Age of Faith; 4, the Age of Reason; 5, the Age of
Decrepitude.  Ancient Greece, he thinks, passed through all those
stages, the age of reason beginning with the advent of physical
science.  Europe as a whole has now also entered the age of reason,
which as before he identifies with the age of physical science; so that
everywhere in his historical works, physical influences and the scientific
knowledge of physical phenomena are credited with most of the
progress that mankind has made. Draper has left a distinct mark
upon the scientific thought of his generation, and made a distinct and
valuable contribution to the literature of his adopted country.</p>

<h3><a name="VEDAS" id="VEDAS"></a>THE VEDAS AND THEIR THEOLOGY</h3>

<h4>From 'History of the Intellectual Development of Europe.' Copyright 1876,
by Harper &amp; Brothers</h4>

<p>The Vedas, which are the Hindu Scriptures, and of which there are
four,&mdash;the Rig, Yagust, Saman, and Atharvan,&mdash;are asserted
to have been revealed by Brahma. The fourth is however rejected by
some authorities, and bears internal evidence of a later composition,
at a time when hierarchical power had become greatly consolidated.
These works are written in an obsolete Sanskrit, the parent of the
more recent idiom. They constitute the basis of an extensive
literature, Upavedas, Angas, etc., of connected works and
commentaries. For the most part they consist of hymns suitable for
public and private occasions, prayers, precepts, legends, and dogmas.
The Rig, which is the oldest, is composed chiefly of hymns; the other
three of liturgical formulas. They are of different periods and of
various authorship, internal evidence seeming to indicate that if the
later were composed by priests, the earlier were the production of
military chieftains. They answer to a state of society advanced from
the nomad to the municipal condition. They are based upon an
acknowledgment of a universal Spirit, pervading all things.
Of this God they therefore necessarily acknowledge the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4867" id="Page_4867">[Pg 4867]</a></span>
unity: "There is in truth but one Deity, the Supreme Spirit, the Lord
of the universe, whose work is the universe." "The God above all gods,
who created the earth, the heavens, and waters." The world, thus
considered as an emanation of God, is therefore a part of him; it is
kept in a visible state by his energy, and would instantly disappear
if that energy were for a moment withdrawn. Even as it is, it is
undergoing unceasing transformations, everything being in a transitory
condition. The moment a given phase is reached, it is departed from,
or ceases. In these perpetual movements the present can scarcely be
said to have any existence, for as the Past is ending, the Future has
begun.</p>

<p>In such a never-ceasing career all material things are urged, their
forms continually changing, and returning as it were through revolving
cycles to similar states. For this reason it is that we may regard our
earth and the various celestial bodies as having had a moment of
birth, as having a time of continuance, in which they are passing
onward to an inevitable destruction; and that after the lapse of
countless ages similar progresses will be made, and similar series of
events will occur again and again.</p>

<p>But in this doctrine of universal transformation there is something
more than appears at first. The theology of India is underlaid with
Pantheism. "God is One because he is All." The Vedas, in speaking of
the relation of nature to God, make use of the expression that he is
the material as well as the cause of the universe, "the clay as well
as the Potter." They convey the idea that while there is a pervading
spirit existing everywhere, of the same nature as the soul of man,
though differing from it infinitely in degree, visible nature is
essentially and inseparably connected therewith; that as in man the
body is perpetually undergoing changes, perpetually decaying and being
renewed,&mdash;or as in the case of the whole human species, nations come
into existence and pass away,&mdash;yet still there continues to exist what
may be termed the universal human mind, so forever associated and
forever connected are the material and the spiritual. And under this
aspect we must contemplate the Supreme Being, not merely as a
presiding intellect, but as illustrated by the parallel case of man,
whose mental principle shows no tokens except through its connection
with the body: so matter, or nature, or the visible universe, is to be
looked upon as the corporeal manifestation of God.</p>

<p>As man advances in knowledge, he discovers that of his primitive
conclusions some are doubtless erroneous, and many require better
evidence to establish their truth incontestably. A more prolonged and
attentive examination gives him reason, in some of the most important
particulars, to change his mind. He finds that the earth on which he
lives is not a floor covered over with a starry dome, as he once
supposed, but a globe self-balanced in space. The crystalline vault,
or sky, is recognized to be an optical deception. It rests upon the
earth nowhere, and is no boundary at all; there is no kingdom of
happiness above it, but a limitless space adorned with planets and
suns. Instead of a realm of darkness and woe in the depths on the
other side of the earth, men like ourselves are found there, pursuing,
in Australia and New Zealand, the innocent pleasures and encountering
the ordinary labors of life. By the aid of such lights as knowledge
gradually supplies, he comes at last to discover that this our
terrestrial habitation, instead of being a chosen, a sacred spot, is
only one of similar myriads, more numerous than the sands of the sea,
and prodigally scattered through space.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, was a more important truth discovered. All the visible
evidence was in direct opposition to it. The earth, which had hitherto
seemed to be the very emblem of immobility, was demonstrated to be
carried with a double motion, with prodigious velocity, through the
heavens; the rising and setting of the stars were proved to be an
illusion; and as respects the size of the globe, it was shown to be
altogether insignificant when compared with multitudes of other
neighboring ones&mdash;insignificant doubly by reason of its actual
dimensions, and by the countless numbers of others like it in form,
and doubtless like it the abodes of many orders of life.</p>

<p>And so it turns out that our earth is a globe of about twenty-five
thousand miles in circumference. The voyager who circumnavigates it
spends no inconsiderable portion of his life in accomplishing his
task. It moves round the sun in a year, but at so great a distance
from that luminary that if seen from him, it would look like a little
spark traversing the sky. It is thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4869" id="Page_4869">[Pg 4869]</a></span>
recognized as one of the members of the solar system. Other similar
bodies, some of which are of larger, some of smaller dimensions,
perform similar revolutions round the sun in appropriate periods of
time.</p>

<p>If the magnitude of the earth be too great for us to attach to it any
definite conception, what shall we say of the compass of the solar
system? There is a defect in the human intellect, which incapacitates
us for comprehending distances and periods that are either too
colossal or too minute. We gain no clearer insight into the matter,
when we are told that a comet which does not pass beyond the bounds of
the system may perhaps be absent on its journey for more than a
thousand years. Distances and periods such as these are beyond our
grasp. They prove to us how far human reason excels imagination; the
one measuring and comparing things of which the other can form no
conception, but in the attempt is utterly bewildered and lost.</p>

<p>But as there are other globes like our earth, so too there are other
worlds like our solar system. There are self-luminous suns, exceeding
in number all computation. The dimensions of this earth pass into
nothingness in comparison with the dimensions of the solar system, and
that system in its turn is only an invisible point if placed in
relation with the countless hosts of other systems, which form with it
clusters of stars. Our solar system, far from being alone in the
universe, is only one of an extensive brotherhood, bound by common
laws and subject to like influences. Even on the very verge of
creation, where imagination might lay the beginning of the realms of
chaos, we see unbounded proofs of order, a regularity in the
arrangement of inanimate things, suggesting to us that there are other
intellectual creatures like us, the tenants of those islands in the
abysses of space.</p>

<p>Though it may take a beam of light a million years to bring to our
view those distant worlds, the end is not yet. Far away in the depths
of space we catch the faint gleams of other groups of stars like our
own. The finger of a man can hide them in their remoteness. Their vast
distances from one another have dwindled into nothing. They and their
movements have lost all individuality; the innumerable suns of which
they are composed blend all their collected light into one pale milky
glow.</p>

<p>Thus extending our view from the earth to the solar system,
from the solar system to the expanse of the group of stars to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4870" id="Page_4870">[Pg 4870]</a></span>
which we belong, we behold a series of gigantic nebular creations rising up
one after another, and forming greater and greater colonies of worlds. No
numbers can express them, for they make the firmament a haze of stars.
Uniformity, even though it be the uniformity of magnificence, tires at
last, and we abandon the survey; for our eyes can only behold a
boundless prospect, and conscience tells us our own unspeakable
insignificance.</p>

<p>But what has become of the time-honored doctrine of the human destiny
of the universe?&mdash;that doctrine for the sake of which the controversy
I have described in this chapter was raised? It has disappeared. In
vain was Bruno burnt and Galileo imprisoned; the truth forced its way,
in spite of all opposition, at last. The end of the conflict was a
total rejection of authority and tradition, and the adoption of
scientific truth.</p>

<h3><a name="KORAN" id="KORAN"></a>THE KORAN</h3>

<p>Arabian influence, thus imposing itself on Africa and Asia by military
successes, and threatening even Constantinople, rested essentially on
an intellectual basis, the value of which it is needful for us to
consider. The Koran, which is that basis, has exercised a great
control over the destinies of mankind, and still serves as a rule of
life to a very large portion of our race. Considering the asserted
origin of this book,&mdash;indirectly from God himself,&mdash;we might justly
expect that it would bear to be tried by any standard that man can
apply, and vindicate its truth and excellence in the ordeal of human
criticism. In our estimate of it, we must constantly bear in mind that
it does not profess to be successive revelations made at intervals of
ages and on various occasions, but a complete production delivered to
one man. We ought therefore to look for universality, completeness,
perfection. We might expect that it would present us with just views
of the nature and position of this world in which we live, and that
whether dealing with the spiritual or the material, it would put to
shame the most celebrated productions of human genius, as the magnificent
mechanism of the heavens and the beautiful living forms of the earth are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4871" id="Page_4871">[Pg 4871]</a></span>
superior to the vain contrivances of man. Far in advance
of all that has been written by the sages of India, or the
philosophers of Greece, on points connected with the origin, nature,
and destiny of the universe, its dignity of conception and excellence
of expression should be in harmony with the greatness of the subject
with which it is concerned.</p>

<p>The scribes of the East are distinguished by their efforts to acquire
a perfect style of execution; and their success merits the greater
praise, since they generally stand while writing, resting only on the
left arm; and notwithstanding the inferiority of the reed to the
modern pen, the Arabs have succeeded in producing the most excellent
specimens of calligraphy.</p>

<p>We might expect that it should propound with authority, and
definitively settle, those all-important problems which have exercised
the mental powers of the ablest men of Asia and Europe for so many
centuries, and which are at the foundation of all faith and all
philosophy; that it should distinctly tell us in unmistakable language
what is God, what is the world, what is the soul, and whether man has
any criterion of truth; that it should explain to us how evil can
exist in a world the Maker of which is omnipotent and altogether good;
that it should reveal to us in what the affairs of men are fixed by
Destiny, in what by free-will; that it should teach us whence we came,
what is the object of our continuing here, what is to become of us
hereafter. And since a written work claiming a divine origin must
necessarily accredit itself even to those most reluctant to receive
it, its internal evidences becoming stronger and not weaker with the
strictness of the examination to which they are submitted, it ought to
deal with those things that may be demonstrated by the increasing
knowledge and genius of man; anticipating therein his conclusions.</p>

<p>Such a work, noble as may be its origin, must not refuse but court the
test of natural philosophy, regarding it not as an antagonist but as
its best support. As years pass on, and human science becomes more
exact and more comprehensive, its conclusions must be found in unison
therewith. When occasion arises, it should furnish us at least the
foreshadowings of the great truths discovered by astronomy and
geology, not offering for them the wild fictions of earlier ages,
inventions of the infancy of man. It should tell us how suns and
worlds are distributed in infinite space, and how in their successions
they come forth in limitless time. It should say how far the dominion
of God is carried out by law, and what is the point at which it is his
pleasure to resort to his own good providence or his arbitrary will.
How grand the description of this magnificent universe, written
by the Omnipotent hand! Of man it should set forth his relations
to other living beings, his place among them, his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4872" id="Page_4872">[Pg 4872]</a></span>
privileges and responsibilities. It should not leave him to grope his way
through the vestiges of Greek philosophy, and to miss the truth at last;
but it should teach him wherein true knowledge consists, anticipating the
physical science, physical power, and physical well-being of our own
times, nay, even unfolding for our benefit things that we are still
ignorant of. The discussion of subjects so many and so high is not
outside the scope of a work of such pretensions. Its manner of dealing
with them is the only criterion it can offer of its authenticity to
succeeding times.</p>

<p>Tried by such a standard, the Koran altogether fails. In its
philosophy it is incomparably inferior to the writings of Chakia
Mouni, the founder of Buddhism; in its science it is absolutely
worthless. On speculative or doubtful things it is copious enough; but
in the exact, where a test can be applied to it, it totally fails. Its
astronomy, cosmogony, physiology, are so puerile as to invite our
mirth, if the occasion did not forbid. They belong to the old times of
the world, the morning of human knowledge. The earth is firmly
balanced in its seat by the weight of the mountains; the sky is
supported over it like a dome, and we are instructed in the wisdom and
power of God by being told to find a crack in it if we can. Ranged in
stories, seven in number, are the heavens, the highest being the
habitation of God, whose throne&mdash;for the Koran does not reject
Assyrian ideas&mdash;is sustained by winged animal forms. The shooting
stars are pieces of red-hot stone, thrown by angels at impure spirits
when they approach too closely. Of God the Koran is full of praise,
setting forth, often in not unworthy imagery, his majesty. Though it
bitterly denounces those who give him any equals, and assures them
that their sin will never be forgiven; that in the Judgment Day they
must answer the fearful question, "Where are my companions about whom
ye disputed?"&mdash;though it inculcates an absolute dependence on the
mercy of God, and denounces as criminals all those who make a
merchandise of religion,&mdash;its ideas of the Deity are altogether
anthropomorphic. He is only a gigantic man, living in a paradise. In
this respect, though exceptional passages might be cited, the reader
rises from a perusal of the one hundred and fourteen chapters of the
Koran with a final impression that they have given him low and
unworthy thoughts; nor is it surprising that one of the Mohammedan
sects reads it in such a way as to find no difficulty in asserting that "from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4873" id="Page_4873">[Pg 4873]</a></span>
the crown of the head to the breast God is hollow, and
from the breast downward he is solid;" that he "has curled black hair,
and roars like a lion at every watch of the night." The unity asserted
by Mohammed is a unity in special contradistinction to the Trinity of
the Christians, and the doctrine of a Divine generation. Our Savior is
never called the Son of God, but always the Son of Mary. Throughout
there is a perpetual acceptance of the delusion of the human destiny
of the universe. As to man, Mohammed is diffuse enough respecting a
future state, speaking with clearness of a resurrection, the Judgment
Day, Paradise, the torment of hell, the worm that never dies, the
pains that never end; but with all this precise description of the
future, there are many errors as to the past. If modesty did not
render it unsuitable to speak of such topics here, it might be shown
how feeble is his physiology when he has occasion to allude to the
origin or generation of man. He is hardly advanced beyond the ideas of
Thales. One who is so untrustworthy a guide as to things that are past
cannot be very trustworthy as to events that are to come.</p>

<p>Of the literary execution of his work, it is perhaps scarcely possible
to judge fairly from a translation. It is said to be the oldest prose
composition among the Arabs, by whom Mohammed's boast of the
unapproachable excellence of his work is almost universally sustained;
but it must not be concealed that there have been among them very
learned men who have held it in light esteem. Its most celebrated
passages, as those on the nature of God, in Chapters ii., xxiv., will
bear no comparison with parallel ones in the Psalms and Book of Job.
In the narrative style, the story of Joseph in Chapter xii., compared
with the same incidents related in Genesis, shows a like inferiority.
Mohammed also adulterates his work with many Christian legends,
derived probably from the apocryphal gospel of St. Barnabas; he mixes
with many of his own inventions the Scripture account of the
temptation of Adam, the Deluge, Jonah and the whale, enriching the
whole with stories like the later Night Entertainments of his country,
the seven sleepers, Gog and Magog, and all the wonders of genii,
sorcery, and charms.</p>

<p>An impartial reader of the Koran may doubtless be surprised that so
feeble a production should serve its purpose so well. But the theory
of religion is one thing, the practice another. The Koran abounds in
excellent moral suggestions and precepts; its composition is so
fragmentary that we cannot turn to a single
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4874" id="Page_4874">[Pg 4874]</a></span>
page without finding maxims of which all men must approve. This fragmentary
construction yields texts and mottoes and rules complete in themselves,
suitable for common men in any of the incidents of life. There is a
perpetual insisting on the necessity of prayer, an inculcation of mercy,
almsgiving, justice, fasting, pilgrimage, and other good works;
institutions respecting conduct, both social and domestic, debts,
witnesses, marriage, children, wine, and the like; above all, a
constant stimulation to do battle with the infidel and blasphemer. For
life as it passes in Asia, there is hardly a condition in which
passages from the Koran cannot be recalled suitable for instruction,
admonition, consolation, encouragement. To the Asiatic and to the
African, such devotional fragments are of far more use than any
sustained theological doctrine. The mental constitution of Mohammed
did not enable him to handle important philosophical questions with
the well-balanced ability of the great Greek and Indian writers; but
he has never been surpassed in adaptation to the spiritual wants of
humble life, making even his fearful fatalism administer thereto. A
pitiless destiny is awaiting us; yet the prophet is uncertain what it
may be. "Unto every nation a fixed time is decreed. Death will
overtake us even in lofty towers, but God only knoweth the place in
which a man shall die." After many an admonition of the resurrection
and the Judgment Day, many a promise of Paradise and threat of hell,
he plaintively confesses, "I do not know what will be done with you or
me hereafter."</p>

<p>The Koran thus betrays a human and not a very noble intellectual
origin. It does not however follow that its author was, as is so often
asserted, a mere impostor. He reiterates again and again, "I am
nothing more than a public preacher." He defends, not always without
acerbity, his work from those who even in his own life stigmatized it
as a confused heap of dreams, or what is worse, a forgery. He is not
the only man who has supposed himself to be the subject of
supernatural and divine communications, for this is a condition of
disease to which any one, by fasting and mental anxiety, may be
reduced.</p>

<p>In what I have thus said respecting a work held by so many millions of
men as a revelation from God, I have endeavored to speak with respect
and yet with freedom, constantly bearing in mind how deeply to this
book Asia and Africa are indebted for daily guidance, how deeply
Europe and America for the light of science.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4875" id="Page_4875">[Pg 4875]</a></span>
As might be expected, the doctrines of the Koran have received many
fictitious additions and sectarian interpretations in the course of
ages. In the popular superstition angels and genii largely figure. The
latter, being of a grosser fabric, eat, drink, propagate their kind,
are of two sorts, good and bad, and existed long before men, having
occupied the earth before Adam. Immediately after death, two greenish
livid angels, Monkir and Nekkar, examine every corpse as to its faith
in God and Mohammed; but the soul, having been separated from the body
by the angel of death, enters upon an intermediate state, awaiting the
resurrection. There is however much diversity of opinion as to its
precise disposal before the Judgment Day: some think that it hovers
near the grave; some, that it sinks into the well Zemzem; some, that
it retires into the trumpet of the angel of the resurrection; the
difficulty apparently being that any final disposal before the Day of
Judgment would be anticipatory of that great event, if indeed it would
not render it needless. As to the resurrection, some believe it to be
merely spiritual, others corporeal; the latter asserting that the <i>os
coccygis</i>, or last bone of the spinal column, will serve as it were as
a germ; and that, vivified by a rain of forty days, the body will
sprout from it. Among the signs of the approaching resurrection will
be the rising of the sun in the west. It will be ushered in by three
blasts of a trumpet: the first, known as the blast of consternation,
will shake the earth to its centre, and extinguish the sun and stars;
the second, the blast of extermination, will annihilate all material
things except Paradise, hell, and the throne of God. Forty years
subsequently, the angel Israfil will sound the blast of resurrection.
From his trumpet there will be blown forth the countless myriads of
souls who have taken refuge therein, or lain concealed. The Day of
Judgment has now come. The Koran contradicts itself as to the length
of this day; in one place making it a thousand, in another fifty
thousand years. Most Mohammedans incline to adopt the longer period,
since angels, genii, men, and animals have to be tried.</p>

<p>As to men, they will rise in their natural state, but naked;
white-winged camels, with saddles of gold, awaiting the saved.
When the partition is made, the wicked will be oppressed with
an intolerable heat, caused by the sun, which, having been called
into existence again, will approach within a mile, provoking a
sweat to issue from them; and this, according to their demerits,
will immerse them from the ankles to the mouth; but the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4876" id="Page_4876">[Pg 4876]</a></span>
righteous will be screened by the shadow of the throne of God.
The Judge will be seated in the clouds, the books open before
him, and everything in its turn called on to account for its deeds.
For greater dispatch, the angel Gabriel will hold forth his balance,
one scale of which hangs over Paradise and one over hell.
In these all works are weighed. As soon as the sentence is delivered,
the assembly, in a long file, will pass over the bridge
Al-Sirat. It is as sharp as the edge of a sword, and laid over
the mouth of hell. Mohammed and his followers will successfully
pass the perilous ordeal; but the sinners, giddy with terror, will
drop into the place of torment. The blessed will receive their
first taste of happiness at a pond which is supplied by silver
pipes from the river Al-Cawthor. The soil of Paradise is of
musk. Its rivers tranquilly flow over pebbles of rubies and
emeralds. From tents of hollow pearls the Houris, or girls of
Paradise, will come forth, attended by troops of beautiful boys.
Each saint will have eighty thousand servants and seventy-two
girls. To these, some of the more merciful Mussulmans add the
wives they have had upon earth; but the grimly orthodox assert
that hell is already nearly filled with women. How can it be
otherwise, since they are not permitted to pray in a mosque upon
earth?</p>

<p>I have not space to describe the silk brocades, the green
clothing, the soft carpets, the banquets, the perpetual music and
songs. From the glorified body all impurities will escape, not as
they did during life, but in a fragrant perspiration of camphor
and musk. No one will complain, "I am weary;" no one will
say, "I am sick.".</p>

<p>From the contradictions, puerilities, and impossibilities indicated
in the preceding paragraphs, it may be anticipated that the
faith of Mohammed has been broken into many sects. Of such
it is said that not less than seventy-three may be numbered.
Some, as the Sonnites, are guided by traditions; some occupy
themselves with philosophical difficulties,&mdash;the existence of evil
in the world, the attributes of God, absolute predestination and
eternal damnation, the invisibility and non-corporeality of God,
his capability of local motion.... But the great Mohammedan
philosophers, simply accepting the doctrine of the oneness
of God as the only thing of which man can be certain, look upon
all the rest as idle fables&mdash;having however this political use: that
they furnish contention and therefore occupation to disputatious
sectarians, and consolation to illiterate minds.</p>

Low Countries; while Marlowe was working out the tragedy that was to
revolutionize all stage traditions, and Shakespeare was yet but a
"looker-on at greatness,"&mdash;there came up from Warwickshire a young man
of good family who had served as page in a noble house, who had
studied possibly at Oxford, and who in the first flush of manhood
aspired to a place among those prodigies who made the later
Elizabethan period immortal. This was Michael Drayton, whose gentle
birth and breeding, education and talents, knowledge of the world and
of men, together with a most sweet and lovable disposition, made him
at once welcome in the literary Bohemia of the day. He became the
"deare and bosom friend" of Beaumont and Fletcher, and his work
received unquestioned honor from his illustrious contemporaries.</p>

</div>

<p>As a child he had demanded of his
elders to know what kind of beings poets
were, had spent many hours in writing
childishly fantastic verses, and had begged
of his tutor to make a poet of him.  And although he seems to have
been poor and to have lived by the gifts of wealthy patrons, he
cast in his lot with literature, and cherished no other ambition than
that of writing well.  His first book, a volume of spiritual poems, or
metrical renderings of the Bible, was published in 1590 under the
title 'The Harmony of the Church.'  It is difficult to see why this
commonplace and orthodox performance should have given such
umbrage that the Archbishop of Canterbury condemned the entire
edition to destruction.  Yet this was its fate, with the exception of
forty copies which Archbishop Whitgift ordered to be reserved for
the ecclesiastical library at Lambeth Palace.  Undiscouraged, the
poet next produced a cycle of sixty-four sonnets and a collection of
pastorals entitled 'Idea:  the Shepherd's Garland,' in which under the
name "Rowland" he celebrated an early love.  It is strange that
the intrinsic merit of these verses, and their undoubted popularity,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4878" id="Page_4878">[Pg 4878]</a></span>
should not have urged Drayton to continue in the same vein.  Instead,
however, he set about the composition of a series of historical
poems which extended over the next twenty-four years, and to which
he gave the best energies of his life.  Beginning with the epic
'Matilda,' studied from English history, the series was continued by
a poem on the 'Wars of the Roses,' afterward enlarged into 'The
Barons' Wars.'  This was followed by the epic 'Robert, Duke of
Normandy.' Destitute of imagination, prolix and tedious, these verses
were yet so popular in Drayton's day that in 1612 he began the
publication of a poem in thirty books, meant to include the entire
chronology and topography of Great Britain, from the earliest times.
This was the famous 'Poly-Olbion,' in which, in spite of the inspiring
work of his contemporaries, Drayton harked back in spirit to the
dreary monotony of the Saxon Chronicle; the detail is so minute,
the matter so unimportant, and the absence of discrimination so apparent,
that notwithstanding many noticeable beauties of thought
and style, it is hard to realize that this poem was a favorite with
that brilliant group which had known Shakespeare, and still delighted
in Ben Jonson.  After issuing eighteen books of 'Poly-Olbion,' his
publishers&mdash;with whom he was always quarreling, and whom he
declared that he "despised and kicked at"&mdash;refused to undertake the
remaining twelve books of the second part.  His friends, however,
loyal in their love and praise of him, secured a more complaisant
tradesman to bring out the rest of the already famous poem.</p>

<p>Fortunately for his fame, Drayton had in the mean time produced
two other volumes of verse, which displayed the real grace and fancifulness
of his charming muse.  The first of these, 'Poems Lyrical
and Pastoral,' included the satire 'The Man in the Moon'; while in
the second were printed the 'Ballad of Agincourt,' the most spirited
of English martial lyrics, and that delightful fantasy 'Nymphidia, or
the Court of Faery,' in which the touch is so light, the fancy so
dainty, and the conceit so delicate, that the poem remains immortally
fresh and young.  Because everybody wrote plays, Drayton turned
playwright, and is said to have collaborated with Massinger and Ford.
Of his long works, the 'Heroicall Episodes' is perhaps the most
readable.  His last effort was 'The Muses' Elizium,' published in 1630.
A year later he died, and was buried in Westminster, where a monument
was erected to him by the Countess of Dorset.</p>

<p>Drayton's place in English literature is with that considerable and
not unimportant band who have done somewhat, but whose repute is much
more for what they were in their friends' eyes than for what they did.
In an age of great intellectual achievement, he yet managed, in spite
of the stimulus of kindred minds and his own undoubted gift, to
produce little that has sustained the reputation accorded him
by his acquaintances. Most of his work lives chiefly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4879" id="Page_4879">[Pg 4879]</a></span>
to afford pleasing studies for the literary antiquary, to whom the tide of
time brings nothing uninteresting. Yet in the art of living, in the unselfish
devotion of his powers to his chosen calling, in the graces of
affection and the offices of noble friendship, he was so excellent and
exemplary that he won and kept the undying regard of the most able men
of the most brilliant period of English literature&mdash;men who felt a
personal and unrequitable loss when he passed away, and who spoke of
him always with admiring tenderness.</p>

<p>In person he seems to have been small and dark.  He describes
himself as of "swart and melancholy face."  Yet his talk was most
delightful, and a strong proof of his wide popularity appears in the
fact that he is quoted not less than one hundred and fifty times in
'England's Parnassus,' published as early as 1600.  The tributes of
his friends are innumerable, from the "good Rowland" of Barnfield
to the "golden-mouthed Drayton, musicall," of Fitz-Geoffrey, the
"man of vertuous disposition, honest conversation, and well-preserved
carriage" of Meres, or the tender lines of his friend Ben Jonson:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="GUSTAVE_DROZ" id="GUSTAVE_DROZ"></a>GUSTAVE DROZ</h2>

<h4>(1832-1895)</h4>

<img src="images/capg223.png" width="90" height="90" alt="G" title="G" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ustave Droz enjoyed for a time the distinction of being the most
popular writer of light literature in France, and his fame extended
throughout Europe and to America, several of his books having been
translated into English. Essentially a Parisian of the day,&mdash;gay,
droll, adroit,&mdash;he not only caught and reflected the humor of his
countrymen, but with a new, fresh touch, reached below the surface of
their volatile emotions. Occasionally striking the note of deeper
feeling, he avoided as a rule the more serious sides of life, as well
as the sensational tendencies of most of his contemporaries. His
friends claimed for him a distinctive <i>genre</i>, and on that account
presented him as a candidate for the Academy; but he failed of
election.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gustave Droz</span></span>
</div>

<p>The son of a well-known sculptor, he was born in Paris, and followed
the traditions of his family in entering the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts,
where he developed some aptitude with his brush; but a preference for
writing beguiled him from the studio, and an acquaintance with
Marcellin the illustrator, founder of La Vie Parisienne, led him to
follow literature. At first he was timid, dreading the test of
publication, but presently he gave himself up unreservedly to his pen.
Within a year he was established as a favorite of the people, and his
friend's journal was on the highway to success. For this he wrote a
series of sketches of every-day life that were subsequently collected
and published in book form, under the titles 'Monsieur, Madame, et
B&eacute;b&eacute;,' 'Entre Nous,' and 'La Cahier Bleu de Mlle. Cibot.'
Within two years these books had reached their twentieth edition, and of the
first, nearly one hundred and fifty editions have been demanded since
it was issued. He has written several novels, the best known of which
are 'Babolein,' 'Les &Eacute;tangs' (The Ponds), and 'Autour d'une Source'
(Around a Spring), but they did not fully sustain the reputation gained by
his short sketches; a fact which induced him in 1884 to return to his
earlier form in 'Tristesses et Sourires' (Sorrows and Smiles), a volume of light
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4886" id="Page_4886">[Pg 4886]</a></span>
dissertations on things grave and gay that at once revived his popularity.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the work of Gustave Droz is its delicacy both
in humor and pathos. He surprised the French by making them all
laugh without making any of them wince; the sharp wits of his day
were forgotten in the unalloyed enjoyment of his simple quaintness,
in which there was neither affectation nor sarcasm. Yet as has been
said, he was a Parisian of the Parisians, quick to perceive the ludicrous,
ready to weep with the afflicted, and to laugh again with the
happy. His studies of children are among his best, on account
of their extreme naturalness, and are never uninteresting, despite
the simplicity of the incidents and observations on which they are
founded. In 'Le Cahier Bleu de Mlle. Cibot' he has used striking
colors to paint the petty afflictions that beset most lives; but lest
these pictures should leave an unpleasant impression, they are set off
by others of a happier sort, making a collection that constitutes a
most effective lesson in practical philosophy.</p>

<h3><a name="BABY" id="BABY"></a>HOW THE BABY WAS SAVED</h3>
<h4>From 'The Seamstress's Story'</h4>

<p>"Yes, Ma'm'selle Ad&egrave;le," said the seamstress, "the real happiness of
this world is not so unevenly distributed after all." Louise, as she
said this, took from the reserve in the bosom of her dress a lot of
pins, and applied them deftly to the trimming of a skirt which I was
holding for her.</p>

<p>"A sufficiently comfortable doctrine," I answered; "but it
does seem to me as if some people were born to live and to die
unhappy."</p>

<p>"It is only folks who never find anybody to love enough; and
I think it's nobody's fault but their own."</p>

<p>"But my good Louise, wouldn't you have suffered much less
last year, when you came so near losing your boy, if you hadn't
cared so much for him?"</p>

<p>I was only drawing her on, you see; Louise's chat was the
greatest resource to me at that time.</p>

<p>"Why, Ma'm'selle Ad&egrave;le, you are surely joking. You'd as
well tell me to cut off my feet to save my shoes. You'll know
one of these days&mdash;and not so far off neither, maybe&mdash;how
mighty easy and sensible it would be not to love your children.
They <i>are</i> a worry, too; but oh the delight of 'em! I'd like to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4887" id="Page_4887">[Pg 4887]</a></span>
have had anybody tell me not to love my darling because it
might grieve me, when he lay there in his mother's lap, with
blue lips, gasping for his breath, and well-nigh dead, his face
blackish, and his hands like this piece of wax. You could see
that everything was going against him; and with his great big
eyes he was staring in my face, until I felt as if the child was
tugging at my very heart-strings. I kept smiling at him, though,
through the tears that blinded me, hard as I tried to hide them.
Oh! such tears are bitter salt indeed, Ma'm'selle! And there
was my poor husband on his knees, making paper figures to
amuse him, and singing a funny song he used to laugh at. Now
and then the corners of his mouth would pucker, and his cheeks
would wrinkle a little bit under the eyes. You could tell he was
still amused, but in such a dreamy way. Oh! our child seemed
no longer with us, but behind a veil, like. Wait a minute.
You must excuse me, for I can't help crying when I think of it."</p>

<p>And the poor creature drew out her handkerchief and fairly
sobbed aloud. In the midst of it however she smiled and said:
"Well, that's over now; 'twas nothing, and I'm too silly. And
Ma'm'selle, here I've gone and cried upon your mother's dress,
and that's a pretty business."</p>

<p>I took her hand in mine and pressed it.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid you'll stick yourself, Ma'm'selle? I've got
my needle in that hand," she said playfully. "But you did not
mean what you said just now, did you?"</p>

<p>"What did I say?"</p>

<p>"That it would be better not to love your children with all
your heart, on account of the great anxiety. Don't you know
such thoughts are wicked? When they come into your head
your mind wants purifying. But I'm sure I beg your pardon
for saying so."</p>

<p>"You are entirely right, Louise," I returned.</p>

<p>"Ah! so I thought. And now let me see. Let's fix this
ruche; pull it to the left a little, please."</p>

<p>"But about the sick boy. Tell me about his recovery."</p>

<p>"That was a miracle&mdash;I ought to say two miracles. It was
a miracle that God restored him to us, and a miracle to find
anybody with so much knowledge and feeling,&mdash;such talent, such
a tender heart, and so much, so much&mdash;! I'm speaking of
the doctor. A famous one he was, too, you must know; for it
was no less than Doctor Faron. Heaven knows how he is run
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4888" id="Page_4888">[Pg 4888]</a></span>
after, and how rich and celebrated he is! Aren't you surprised
to hear that it was he who attended <i>our</i> little boy? Indeed, the
wonders begin with that. You may imagine my husband was at
his wits' end when he saw how it was with the child; and all of
a sudden I saw him jump up, get out his best coat and hat, and
put them on.</p>

<p>"'Where are you going' I asked.</p>

<p>"'To bring Doctor Faron.'</p>

<p>"Why, if he had said, 'To bring the Prime Minister,' it
would have seemed as likely.</p>

<p>"'Don't you believe Doctor Faron is going to trouble himself
about such as we. They will turn you out of doors.'</p>

<p>"But 'twas no use talking, my dear. He was already on the
stairs, and I heard him running away as if the house was on fire.
Fire, indeed; worse, far worse than any fire!</p>

<p>"And there I was, left alone with the child upon my knees.
He wouldn't stay in bed, and was quieter so, wrapped up in his
little blanket. 'Here will he die,' I thought. 'Soon will his
eyes close, and then it will be all over;' and I held my own
breath to listen to his feeble and oppressed pantings.</p>

<p>"About an hour had passed, when I heard a rapid step upon
the stairs (we are poor, and live in attic rooms). The door
opened, and my husband came in, wet with perspiration and out
of breath. If I live a century, I'll not forget his look when he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Well?'</p>

<p>"I answered, 'No worse. But the doctor?'</p>

<p>"'He's coming.'</p>

<p>"Oh, those blessed words! It actually seemed as if my child
were saved already. If you but knew how folks love their little
ones! I kissed the darling, I kissed his father, I laughed, I
cried, and I no longer felt the faintest doubt. It is by God's
mercy that such gleams of hope are sent to strengthen us in our
trials. It was very foolish, too; for something might easily have
prevented the doctor's coming, after all.</p>

<p>"'You found him at home, then?' I asked my husband.</p>

<p>"Then he told me in an undertone what he had done, stopping
every now and then to wipe his face and gather breath.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"My husband had scarcely uttered these words," continued
Louise, "when I heard a step on the stairs. It was he! it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4889" id="Page_4889">[Pg 4889]</a></span>
that blessed angel of a doctor, come to help us in our sore distress.</p>

<p>"And what do you think he said in his deep voice when he
got into the room?</p>

<p>"God bless you, my friends, but I nearly broke my neck on
those stairs. Where's that child?"</p>

<p>"'Here he is, my dear, darling doctor.' I knew no better
way to speak to him, with his dress cravat showing over his
greatcoat, and his decorations dangling like a little bunch of keys
at his buttonhole.</p>

<p>"He took off his wrappings, stooped over the child, turned
him over, more gently even than his mother could have done,
and laid his own head first against his back, then against his
breast. How I tried to read his eyes! but they know how to
hide their thoughts.</p>

<p>"'We must perform an operation here,' says he; 'and it is
high time.'</p>

<p>"Just at this moment the hospital doctor came in, and whispered
to him, 'I'm afraid you didn't want to be disturbed, sir.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, never mind. I am sorry it wasn't sooner, though. Get
everything ready now.'</p>

<p>"But Ma'm'selle Ad&egrave;le, why should I tell you all this? I'd
better mind my work."</p>

<p>"Oh, go on, Louise, go on!"</p>

<p>"Well then, Ma'm'selle, if you believe me, those two doctors&mdash;neither
of 'em kin, or even friends till then&mdash;went to work and made all the
preparations, while my husband went off to borrow lights. The biggest
one tied a mattress on the table, and the assistant spread out the
bright little knives.</p>

<p>"You who have not been through it all, Ma'm'selle, can't
know what it is to have your own little one in your lap, to
know that those things are to be used upon him to pierce his
tender flesh, and if the hand that guides them be not sure, that
they may kill him.</p>

<p>"When all was ready, Doctor Faron took off his cravat, then
lifted my child from my arms and laid him on the mattress, in
the midst of the lamps, and said to my poor man:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'You will hold his head, and your wife his feet. Joseph
will pass me the instruments. You've brought a breathing-tube
with you, my son?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4890" id="Page_4890">[Pg 4890]</a></span>
"My husband was as white as a sheet by this; and when I
saw him about to take his place with his hands shaking so much,
it scared me, so I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Doctor, please let me hold his head!"</p>

<p>"'But my poor woman, if you should tremble?'</p>

<p>"'Please let me do it, doctor!'</p>

<p>"'Be it so, then;' and then added with a bright look at me,
and a cheering smile, 'we shall save him for you, my dear; you
are a brave little woman and you deserve it.'</p>

<p>"Yes, and save him he did! God bless him! saved him as
truly as if he had snatched him from the depths of the river."</p>

<p>"And you didn't tremble, Louise?"</p>

<p>"You may depend on that. If I had, it would have been the
last of my child."</p>

<p>"How in the world did you keep yourself steady?"</p>

<p>"The Lord knows; but I was like a rock. When you must,
you must, I suppose."</p>

<p>"And you had to behold every detail of that operation?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; and often have I dreamed it over since. His
poor little neck laid open, and the veins, which the doctor pushed
aside with his fingers, and the little silver tube which he inserted,
and all that; and then the face of the child, changing as
the air passed into his lungs. You've seen a lamp almost out,
when you pour in oil? It was like that. They had laid him
there but half alive, with his eyes all but set; and they gave
him back to me, pale and with bloodless lips, it is true, but with
life in his looks, and breathing&mdash;breathing the free, fresh air.</p>

<p>"'Kiss him, mother,' says the doctor, 'and put him to bed.
Cover the place with some light thing or other, and Joseph must
stay with you to-night; won't you, Joseph? Ah, well, that's all
arranged.'</p>

<p>"He put on his things and wrapped himself up to go. He
was shaking hands with my husband, when I seized one hand,
and kissed it&mdash;like a fool, as I was; but I didn't stop to think.
He laughed heartily, and said to my husband, 'Are you not
jealous, friend? Your wife is making great advances to me.
But I must be off now. Good night, good people.'</p>

<p>"And from that night he always talks so friendly and familiarly
to us, not a bit contemptuously either, but as if he liked
us, and was glad to be of service to us."</p>

<h3><a name="FAMILY" id="FAMILY"></a>A FAMILY NEW-YEAR'S</h3>
<h4>From 'Monsieur, Madame, and Baby'</h4>


<p>It is barely seven o'clock. A pale ray of wan light filters
through the double curtains, and some one is already at the
door. In the next room I hear the stifled laughs and silvery
voice of my little child, who trembles with impatience and begs
to come.</p>

<p>"But father dear," he cries, "it's Baby. It's your own little
boy&mdash;to wish you 'Happy New Year.'"</p>

<p>"Come in, darling; come quick and give me a kiss," I cry.</p>

<p>The door opens, and my boy, with shining eyes and his arms
in the air, rushes toward the bed. Long curls, escaping from
the nightcap which imprisons his blond head, fall over his forehead.
His loose night-shirt, embarrassing his little feet, adds to
his impatience and makes him trip at every step. He has
crossed the room at last, and stretching his hands toward mine,
"Baby wishes you a happy New Year," he says earnestly.</p>

<p>"Poor darling, with his bare feet! Come, dear! Come and
get warm under the covers; come and hide in the quilt."</p>

<p>I draw him to me; but at this movement my wife wakes up
suddenly.... "How you frightened me! I was dreaming
that there was a fire, and these voices in the midst of it! You
are indiscreet with your cries!"</p>

<p>"<i>Our</i> cries! So you forget, dear mamma, that this is New-Year's
day. Baby is waiting for you to wake up, and so am I."</p>

<p>I wrap up my little man in the soft quilt, I bury him in the
eiderdown, and warm his frozen feet with my hands.</p>

<p>"Mother dear, this is New Year," he cries. He draws our
two heads together with his arms, and kisses us anywhere at
random, with his fresh lips. I feel his dimpled hand wandering
about my neck; his little fingers are entangled in my beard. My
mustache pricks the end of his nose. He bursts out laughing,
and throws his head back.</p>

<p>His mother, who has recovered from her fright, draws him
into her arms. She pulls the bell.</p>

<p>"The year begins well, my dears," she says, "but we need a
little light."</p>

<p>"Tell me, mamma, do naughty children have presents at New-Year's?"
says the young dissembler, with an eye on the mountain of boxes and
packages visible in the corner, in spite of the gloom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4892" id="Page_4892">[Pg 4892]</a></span>
The curtains are drawn apart, the blinds are opened, there is
a flood of daylight, the fire crackles gayly on the hearth, and two
large packages, carefully wrapped up, are placed on the bed. One
is for my wife; the other for the boy.</p>

<p>What is it? What will it be? I have heaped up knots, and
tripled the wrappings; and I watch with delight their nervous
fingers, lost in the strings.</p>

<p>My wife gets impatient, smiles, is vexed, kisses me, and asks
for scissors. Baby on his side bites his lips, pulls with all his
might, and at last asks me to help him. He longs to see through
the paper. Desire and expectation are painted on his face. The
convulsive movement of his hand in the folds of the quilt rustles
the silk, and he makes a sound with his lips as though a savory
fruit were approaching them.</p>

<p>The last paper is off, finally the cover is lifted, there is an
outcry of joy.</p>

<p>"My tippet!"</p>

<p>"My menagerie!"</p>

<p>"Like my muff,&mdash;my dear husband!"</p>

<p>"With a real shepherd, on wheels, dear papa, <i>how</i> I love you!"</p>

<p>They hug me, four arms at once wind round and press me
close.  I am stirred&mdash;a tear comes to my eyes; two come to
those of my wife; and Baby, who loses his head, utters a sob as
he kisses my hand.</p>

<p>How absurd! you will say. I don't know whether it is absurd
or not, but it is charming, I promise you. After all, does not
sorrow wring tears enough from us to make up for the solitary
one which joy may call forth? Life is less happy when one
chances it alone; and when the heart is empty, the way seems
long. It is so good to feel one's self loved; to hear the regular
steps of one's fellow travelers beside one; and to think, "They
are there, our three hearts beat together;" and once a year,
when the great clock strikes the first of January, to sit down beside
the way with hands clasped together and eyes fixed upon
the dusty unknown road stretching on to the horizon, and to
embrace and say:&mdash;"We will always love each other, my dear
ones; you depend upon me and I on you. Let us trust and keep
straight on."</p>

<p>And that is how I explain that we weep a little in looking at
a tippet and opening a menagerie.</p>

<h3><a name="EXCURSION" id="EXCURSION"></a>THEIR LAST EXCURSION</h3>
<h4>From 'Making an Omelette': from Lippincott's Magazine, 1871, copyrighted</h4>


<p>In this strange, rude interior, how refined and delicate Louise
looked, with all her dainty appointments of long undressed
kid gloves, jaunty boots, and looped-up petticoat! While I
talked to the wood-cutters she shielded her face from the fire
with her hands, and kept her eye on the butter beginning to
sing in the pan.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose, and taking the pan-handle from the old
woman, said, "Let me help you make the omelette, will you?"
The good woman let go with a smile, and Louise found herself
alone, in the attitude of a fisherman who has just had a nibble.
She stood in the full light of the fire, her eyes fixed on the
melted butter, her arms tense with effort; she was biting her
lips, probably in order to increase her strength.</p>

<p>"It's rather hard on madame's little hands," said the old
man. "I bet it's the first time you ever made an omelette in a
wood-cutter's hut&mdash;isn't it, my young lady?"</p>

<p>Louise nodded yes, without turning her eyes from the omelette.</p>

<p>"The eggs! the eggs!" she suddenly exclaimed, with such a
look of uneasiness that we all burst out laughing&mdash;"hurry with
the eggs! The butter is all puffing up! Be quick&mdash;or I can't
answer for the consequences."</p>

<p>The old woman beat the eggs energetically.</p>

<p>"The herbs!" cried the old man. "The lard and salt!" cried the young
ones. And they all set to work chopping, cutting, piling up, while
Louise, stamping with excitement, called out, "Make haste! make
haste!" Then there was a tremendous bubbling in the pan, and the great
work began. We were all round the fire, gazing with an anxious
interest inspired by our all having had a finger in the pie.</p>

<p>The old woman, on her knees beside a large dish, slipped a knife under
the edge of the omelette, which was turning a fine brown. "Now,
madame, you've only got to turn it over," she said.</p>

<p>"Just one little quick blow," suggested the old man.</p>

<p>"Mustn't be violent," counseled the young one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4894" id="Page_4894">[Pg 4894]</a></span>
"All at once; tip with it, dear!" I said.</p>

<p>"If you all talk at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make haste, madame!"</p>

<p>"If you all talk at once I never shall manage it. It is too awfully
heavy."</p>

<p>"One quick little blow."</p>

<p>"But I can't; it's going over. Oh gracious!"</p>

<p>In the heat of action, her hood had fallen off. Her cheeks were like a
peach, her eyes shone, and though she lamented her fate, she burst
into peals of laughter. At last by a supreme effort the pan moved, and
the omelette rolled over, somewhat heavily, I confess, into the large
dish which the old woman was holding. Never did an omelette look
better!</p>

<p>"I am sure the young lady's arms must be tired," said the old man, as
he began cutting a round loaf into enormous slices.</p>

<p>"Oh no, not so very," my wife answered with a merry laugh; "only I am
crazy to taste my&mdash;our omelette."</p>

<p>We had seated ourselves round the table. When we had eaten and drunk
with the good souls, we rose and made ready to go home. The sun had
set, and the whole family came out of the cabin to see us off and say
good-night.</p>

<p>"Don't you want my son to go with you?" the old woman called after us.</p>

<p>It was growing dark and chilly under the trees, and we gradually
quickened our pace. "Those are happy people," said Louise. "We will
come some morning and breakfast with them,&mdash;shan't we? We can put the
baby in one of the donkey panniers, and in the other a large pasty and
a bottle of wine.&mdash;You are not afraid of losing your way, George?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; no fear of that."</p>

<p>"A pasty and a bottle of wine&mdash;What is that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; the stump of a tree."</p>

<p>"The stump of a tree&mdash;the stump of a tree," she muttered. "Don't you
hear something behind us?"</p>

<p>"It is only the wind in the leaves, or the breaking of a dead branch."</p>

<p>He is fortunate who at night, in the heart of a forest, feels as calm
as at his own fireside. You do not tremble, but you feel the silence.
Involuntarily you look for eyes peering out of the darkness, and you
try to define the confused forms appearing and changing every minute.
Something breaks and sounds beneath
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4895" id="Page_4895">[Pg 4895]</a></span>
your tread, and if you stop you hear the distant melancholy howl of
your watch-dog, the scream of an owl, and other noises, far and near,
not so easily explained. A sense of strangeness surrounds you and
weighs you down. If you are alone, you walk faster; if there are two
of you, you draw close to your companion. My wife clung to my arm.</p>

<p>"Let us turn wood-cutters. We could build a pretty little hut, simple,
but nice enough. I would have curtains to the windows, and a carpet,
and put my piano in one corner." She spoke very low, and occasionally
I felt my hand tremble on her arm.</p>

<p>"You would soon get enough of that, dearest."</p>

<p>"It isn't fair to say so." And in another minute she went on:&mdash;"You
think I don't love you, you and our boy? Oh yes, dear, I love you.
Yes, yes, yes! The happiness that comes every day can't be expressed:
we live on it, so we don't think of it. Like our daily bread&mdash;who
thinks of that? But when you are thinking of yourself, when you put
your head down, and really think, then you say, 'I am ungrateful, for
I am happy, and I give no thanks for it.' Or when we are alone
together, and walking arm-in-arm, now, at this very moment,&mdash;not that
I mean only this moment,&mdash;I love you, I love you." She put her head
down on my arm and pressed it earnestly. "Oh," she said, "if I were to
lose you!" She spoke very low, as if afraid. What had frightened her?
The darkness and the forest, or her own words?</p>

<p>She went on:&mdash;"I have often and often dreamed that I was saying
good-by to you. You both cried, and I pressed you so close to my heart
that there was only one of us. It was a nightmare, you know, but I
don't mind it, for it showed me that my life was in your lives, dear.
What is that cracking noise? Didn't you see something just in front of
us?"</p>

<p>I answered her by taking her in my arms and folding her to my heart.
We walked on, but it was impossible to go on talking. Every now and
then she would stop and say, "Hush! hark! No, it is nothing."</p>

<p>At last we saw ahead of us a little light, now visible, now hidden by
a tree. It was the lamp set for us in our parlor window. We crossed
the stile and were at home. It was high time, for we were wet through.</p>

<p>I brought a huge log, and when the fire had blazed up
we sat down in the great chimney-place. The poor girl was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4896" id="Page_4896">[Pg 4896]</a></span>
shivering. I took off her boots and held her feet to the fire, screening them with my hands.</p>

<p>"Thanks, dear George, thanks!" she said, leaning on my shoulder and
looking at me so tenderly that I felt almost ready to cry.</p>

<p>"What were you saying to me in that horrid wood, my darling?" I asked
her, when she was better.</p>

<p>"You are thinking about that? I was frightened, that is all, and when
you are frightened you see ghosts."</p>

<p>"We shall be wood-cutters, shan't we?"</p>

<p>And kissing me, with a laugh, she replied: "It is bedtime, Jean of the
Woods."</p>

<p>I well remember that walk, for it was our last. Often and often since,
at sunset on a dark day, I have been over the same ground; often and
often I have stopped where she stood, and stooped and pulled aside the
fern, seeking to find, poor fool that I am! the traces of her vanished
footsteps. And I have often halted in the clearing under the birches
which rained down on us, and there in the shadow I have fancied I
caught the flutter of her dress; I have thought I heard her startled
note of fright. And on my way home at night, at every step I have
found a recollection of her in the distant barking and the breaking
branches, as in the trembling of her hand on my arm and the kiss which
I gave her.</p>

<p>Once I went into the wood-hut. I saw it all as before,&mdash;the family,
the smoky interior, the little bench on which we sat,&mdash;and I asked for
something to drink, that I might see the glass her lips had touched.</p>

<p>"The little lady who makes such good omelettes, she isn't sick, for
sure?" asked the old woman.</p>

<p>Probably she saw the tears in my eyes, for she said no more, and I
came away.</p>

<p>And so it is that except in my heart, where she lives and is, all that
was my darling grows faint and dark and dim.</p>

<p>It is the law of life, but it is a cruel law. Even my poor child is
learning to forget, and when I say to him most unwillingly, "Baby
dear, do you remember how your mother did this or that?" he answers
"Yes"; but I see, alas! that he too is ceasing to remember.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">ne of the most widely read of modern essayists, Henry Drummond, was
born at Stirling, Scotland, in 1851. Educated for the ministry, he
passed through the Universities of Edinburgh and T&uuml;bingen, and the
Free Church Divinity Hall, and after ordination was appointed to a
mission chapel at Malta. The beauty and the historic interest of the
famous island roused in him a desire for travel, and in the intervals
of his professional work he has made semi-scientific pilgrimages to
the Rocky Mountains and to South Africa, as well as lecturing tours to
Canada, Australia, and the United States, where his addresses on
scientific, religious, and sociological subjects have attracted large
audiences.</p>

<p>A man of indefatigable industry, he has published many books, the most
widely read of these being 'Natural Law in the Spiritual World' a
study of psychological conditions from the point of view of the
Evolutionist. This work has passed through a large number of editions,
and been translated into French, German, Dutch, and Norwegian.
Scarcely less popular were 'The Greatest Thing in the World' (love),
and 'Pax Vobiscum.' In 1894 he published a volume called 'The Ascent
of Man,' in which he insists that certain altruistic factors modify
the process of Natural Selection. This doctrine elicited much critical
commentary from the stricter sects of the scientists, but the new view
commended itself at once to the general reader.</p>

travels, 'Tropical Africa,' a book whose simplicity and vividness

<h3><a name="AFRICA" id="AFRICA"></a>THE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE</h3>

<h4>From 'Tropical Africa'</h4>

<p>Nothing could more wildly misrepresent the reality than the idea of
one's school days that the heart of Africa is a desert. Africa rises
from its three environing oceans in three great tiers, and the general
physical geography of these has been already sketched:&mdash;first, a coast
line, low and deadly; farther in, a plateau the height of the Scottish
Grampians; farther in still, a higher plateau, covering the country
for thousands of miles with mountain and valley. Now fill in this
sketch, and you have Africa before you. Cover the coast belt with rank
yellow grass; dot here and there a palm; scatter through it a few
demoralized villages; and stock it with the leopard, the hyena, the
crocodile, and the hippopotamus. Clothe the mountainous plateaux next,
both of them, with endless forests; not grand umbrageous forest like
the forests of South America, nor matted jungle like the forests of
India, but with thin, rather weak forest,&mdash;with forest of low trees,
whose half-grown trunks and scanty leaves offer no shade from the
tropical sun. Nor is there anything in these trees to the casual eye
to remind you that you are in the tropics. Here and there one comes
upon a borassus or fan-palm, a candelabra-like euphorbia, a mimosa
aflame with color, or a sepulchral baobab. A close inspection also
will discover curious creepers and climbers; and among the branches
strange orchids hide their eccentric flowers. But the outward type of
tree is the same as we have at home&mdash;trees resembling the ash, the
beech, and the elm, only seldom so large except by the streams, and
never so beautiful. Day after day you may wander through these
forests, with nothing except the climate to remind you where you are.
The beasts to be sure are different, but unless you watch for them you
will seldom see any; the birds are different, but you rarely hear
them; and as for the rocks, they are our own familiar gneisses and
granites, with honest basalt dikes boring through them, and
leopard-skin lichens staining their weathered sides. Thousands and
thousands of miles, then, of vast thin forest, shadeless, trackless,
voiceless,&mdash;forest in mountain and forest in plain,&mdash;this is East
Central Africa.</p>

<p>The indiscriminate praise, formerly lavished on tropical
vegetation, has received many shocks from recent travelers. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4899" id="Page_4899">[Pg 4899]</a></span>
Kaffir-land, South Africa, I have seen one or two forests fine enough to justify
the enthusiasm of arm-chair word-painters of the tropics; but so far as
the central plateau is concerned, the careful judgment of Mr. Alfred
Russell Wallace respecting the equatorial belt in general (a judgment
which has at once sobered all modern descriptions of tropical lands
and made imaginative people more content to stay at home) applies
almost to this whole area. The fairy labyrinth of ferns and palms, the
festoons of climbing plants blocking the paths and scenting the
forests with their resplendent flowers, the gorgeous clouds of
insects, the gayly plumaged birds, the paroquets, the monkey swinging
from his trapeze in the shaded bowers&mdash;these are unknown to Africa.
Once a week you will see a palm; once in three months the monkey will
cross your path; the flowers on the whole are few; the trees are poor;
and to be honest, though the endless forest-clad mountains have a
sublimity of their own, and though there are tropical bits along some
of the mountain streams of exquisite beauty, nowhere is there anything
in grace and sweetness and strength to compare with a Highland glen.
For the most part of the year these forests are jaded and
sun-stricken, carpeted with no moss or alchemylla or scented woodruff,
the bare trunks frescoed with few lichens, their motionless and
unrefreshed leaves drooping sullenly from their sapless boughs.
Flowers there are, small and great, in endless variety; but there is
no display of flowers, no gorgeous show of blossom in the mass, as
when the blazing gorse and heather bloom at home. The dazzling glare
of the sun in the torrid zone has perhaps something to do with this
want of color effect in tropical nature; for there is always about ten
minutes just after sunset when the whole tone of the landscape changes
like magic, and a singular beauty steals over the scene. This is the
sweetest moment of the African day, and night hides only too swiftly
the homelike softness and repose so strangely grateful to the
over-stimulated eye.</p>

<p>Hidden away in these endless forests, like birds' nests in a wood, in
terror of one another and of their common foe the slaver, are small
native villages; and here in his virgin simplicity dwells primeval
man, without clothes, without civilization, without learning, without
religion&mdash;the genuine child of nature, thoughtless, careless, and
contented. This man is apparently quite happy; he has practically no wants.
One stick, pointed, makes him a spear; two sticks rubbed together make him a fire; fifty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4900" id="Page_4900">[Pg 4900]</a></span>
sticks tied together make him a house. The bark he peels from them
makes his clothes; the fruits which hang on them form his food. It is
perfectly astonishing, when one thinks of it, what nature can do for
the animal man, to see with what small capital after all a human being
can get through the world. I once saw an African buried. According to
the custom of his tribe, his entire earthly possessions&mdash;and he
was an average commoner&mdash;were buried with him. Into the grave,
after the body, was lowered the dead man's pipe, then a rough knife,
then a mud bowl, and last his bow and arrows&mdash;the bowstring cut
through the middle, a touching symbol that its work was done. This was
all. Four items, as an auctioneer would say, were the whole belongings
for half a century of this human being. No man knows what a man is
till he has seen what a man can be without, and be withal a man. That
is to say, no man knows how great man is till he has seen how small he
has been once.</p>

<p>The African is often blamed for being lazy, but it is a misuse of
words. He does not need to work; with so bountiful a Nature round him
it would be gratuitous to work. And his indolence, therefore, as it is
called, is just as much a part of himself as his flat nose, and as
little blameworthy as slowness in a tortoise. The fact is, Africa is a

<h3><a name="LAKE" id="LAKE"></a>THE EAST-AFRICAN LAKE COUNTRY</h3>
<h4>From 'Tropical Africa'</h4>

<p>Somewhere in the Shir&eacute; Highlands, in 1859, Livingstone saw a large
lake&mdash;Lake Shirwa&mdash;which is still almost unknown. It lies away to the
east, and is bounded by a range of mountains whose lofty summits are
visible from the hills round Blantyre. Thinking it might be a useful
initiation to African travel if I devoted a short time to its exploration,
I set off one morning, accompanied by two members of the Blantyre
staff and a small retinue of natives. Steering across country in the
direction in which it lay, we found, two days before seeing the actual
water, that we were already on the ancient bed of the lake. Though now
clothed with forest, the whole district has obviously been under water
at a comparatively recent period, and the shores of Lake Shirwa probably
reached at one time to within a few miles of Blantyre itself. On reaching the lake a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4901" id="Page_4901">[Pg 4901]</a></span>
very aged female chief came to see us, and told us how, long, long
ago, a white man came to her village and gave her a present of cloth.
Of the white man, who must have been Livingstone, she spoke very
kindly; and indeed, wherever David Livingstone's footsteps are crossed
in Africa, the fragrance of his memory seems to remain.</p>

<p>The waters of Shirwa are brackish to the taste, and undrinkable; but
the saltness must have a peculiar charm for game, for nowhere else in
Africa did I see such splendid herds of the larger animals as here.
The zebra was especially abundant; and so unaccustomed to be disturbed
are these creatures, that with a little care one could watch their
movements safely within a very few yards. It may seem unorthodox to
say so, but I do not know if among the larger animals there is
anything handsomer in creation than the zebra. At close quarters his
striped coat is all but as fine as the tiger's, while the form and
movement of his body are in every way nobler. The gait, certainly, is
not to be compared for gracefulness with that of the many species of
antelope and deer who nibble the grass beside him, and one can never
quite forget that scientifically he is an ass; but taking him all in
all, this fleet and beautiful animal ought to have a higher place in
the regard of man than he has yet received.</p>

<p>We were much surprised, considering that this region is almost
uninhabited, to discover near the lake shore a native path so beaten,
and so recently beaten, by multitudes of human feet, that it could
only represent some trunk route through the continent. Following it
for a few miles, we soon discovered its function. It was one of the
great slave routes through Africa. Signs of the horrid traffic became
visible on every side; and from symmetrical arrangements of small
piles of stones and freshly cut twigs, planted semaphore-wise upon the
path, our native guides made out that a slave caravan was actually
passing at the time. We were in fact between two portions of it, the
stones and twigs being telegraphic signals between front and rear. Our
natives seemed much alarmed at this discovery, and refused to proceed
unless we promised not to interfere&mdash;a proceeding which, had we
attempted it, would simply have meant murder for ourselves and slavery
for them. Next day from a hill-top we saw the slave encampment far
below, and the ghastly procession marshaling for its march to the
distant coast, which many of the hundreds who composed it would never
reach alive.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4902" id="Page_4902">[Pg 4902]</a></span>
Talking of native foot-paths leads me to turn aside for a moment, to
explain to the uninitiated the true mode of African travel. In spite
of all the books that have been lavished upon us by our great
explorers, few people seem to have any accurate understanding of this
most simple process. Some have the impression that everything is done
in bullock wagons; an idea borrowed from the Cape, but hopelessly
inapplicable to Central Africa, where a wheel at present would be as
great a novelty as a polar bear. Others, at the opposite extreme,
suppose that the explorer works along solely by compass, making a
bee-line for his destination, and steering his caravan through the
trackless wilderness like a ship at sea. Now, it may be a surprise to
the unenlightened to learn that probably no explorer in forcing his
passage through Africa has ever, for more than a few days at a time,
been off some beaten track. Probably no country in the world,
civilized or uncivilized, is better supplied with paths than this
unmapped continent. Every village is connected with some other
village, every tribe with the next tribe, every State with its
neighbor, and therefore with all the rest. The explorer's business is
simply to select from this network of tracks, keep a general
direction, and hold on his way. Let him begin at Zanzibar, plant his
foot on a native foot-path, and set his face towards Tanganyika. In
eight months he will be there. He has simply to persevere. From
village to village he will be handed on, zig-zagging it may be,
sometimes, to avoid the impassable barriers of nature or the rarer
perils of hostile tribes; but never taking to the woods, never guided
solely by the stars, never in fact leaving a beaten track, till
hundreds and hundreds of miles are between him and the sea, and his
interminable foot-path ends with a canoe on the shores of Tanganyika.
Crossing the lake, landing near some native village, he picks up the
thread once more. Again he plods on and on, now on foot, now by canoe,
but always keeping his line of villages, until one day suddenly he
sniffs the sea-breeze again, and his faithful foot-wide guide lands
him on the Atlantic seaboard.</p>

<p>Nor is there any art in finding out these successive villages with
their intercommunicating links. He <i>must</i> find them out. A whole army
of guides, servants, carriers, soldiers, and camp-followers accompany him
in his march, and this nondescript regiment must be fed. Indian corn, cassava,
mawere, beans, and bananas&mdash;these do not grow wild even in Africa. Every meal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4903" id="Page_4903">[Pg 4903]</a></span>
has to be bought and paid for in cloth and
beads; and scarcely three days can pass without a call having to be
made at some village where the necessary supplies can be obtained. A
caravan, as a rule, must live from hand to mouth, and its march
becomes simply a regulated procession through a chain of markets. Not
however that there are any real markets&mdash;there are neither bazaars nor
stores in native Africa. Thousands of the villages through which the
traveler eats his way may never have victualed a caravan before. But
with the chief's consent, which is usually easily purchased for a
showy present, the villagers unlock their larders, the women flock to
the grinding-stones, and basketfuls of food are swiftly exchanged for
unknown equivalents in beads and calico.</p>

<p>The native tracks which I have just described are the same in
character all over Africa. They are veritable foot-paths, never over a
foot in breadth, beaten as hard as adamant, and rutted beneath the
level of the forest bed by centuries of native traffic. As a rule
these foot-paths are marvelously direct. Like the roads of the old
Romans, they run straight on through everything, ridge and mountain
and valley, never shying at obstacles, nor anywhere turning aside to
breathe. Yet within this general straightforwardness there is a
singular eccentricity and indirectness in detail. Although the African
foot-path is on the whole a bee-line, no fifty yards of it are ever
straight. And the reason is not far to seek. If a stone is
encountered, no native will ever think of removing it. Why should he?
It is easier to walk round it. The next man who comes that way will do
the same. He knows that a hundred men are following him; he looks at
the stone; a moment, and it might be unearthed and tossed aside, but
no&mdash;he also holds on his way. It is not that he resents the trouble,
it is the idea that is wanting. It would no more occur to him that
that stone was a displaceable object, and that for the general weal he
might displace it, than that its feldspar was of the orthoclase
variety. Generations and generations of men have passed that stone,
and it still waits for a man with an altruistic idea. But it would be
a very stony country indeed&mdash;and Africa is far from stony&mdash;that would
wholly account for the aggravating obliqueness and indecision of the
African foot-path. Probably each four miles, on an average path, is
spun out, by an infinite series of minor sinuosities, to five or six.
Now, these deflections are not meaningless. Each has some history&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4904" id="Page_4904">[Pg 4904]</a></span>
history dating back perhaps a thousand years, but to which all clue
has centuries ago been lost. The leading cause probably is fallen
trees. When a tree falls across a path no man ever removes it. As in
the case of the stone, the native goes round it. It is too green to
burn in his hut; before it is dry and the white ants have eaten it,
the new detour has become part and parcel of the path. The smaller
irregularities, on the other hand, represent the trees and stumps of
the primeval forest where the track was made at first. But whatever
the cause, it is certain that for persistent straightforwardness in
the general, and utter vacillation and irresolution in the particular,
the African roads are unique in engineering.</p>

<p>Though one of the smaller African lakes, Shirwa is probably larger
than all the lakes of Great Britain put together. With the splendid
environment of mountains on three of its sides, softened and distanced
by perpetual summer haze, it reminds one somewhat of the Great Salt
Lake simmering in the July sun. We pitched our tent for a day or two
on its western shore, among a harmless and surprised people who had
never gazed on the pallid countenances of Englishmen before. Owing to
the ravages of the slaver, the people of Shirwa are few, scattered,
and poor, and live in abiding terror. The densest population is to be
found on the small island, heavily timbered with baobabs, which forms
a picturesque feature of the northern end. These Wa-Nyassa, or people
of the lake, as they call themselves, have been driven away by fear,
and they rarely leave their lake dwelling unless under cover of night.
Even then they are liable to capture by any man of a stronger tribe
who happens to meet them, and numbers who have been kidnapped in this
way are to be found in the villages of neighboring chiefs. This is an
amenity of existence in Africa that strikes one as very terrible. It
is impossible for those at home to understand how literally savage man
is a chattel, and how much his life is spent in the mere safeguarding
of his main asset, <i>i. e.</i>, himself. There are actually districts in
Africa where <i>three</i> natives cannot be sent on a message, in case two
should combine and sell the third before they return.</p>

<h3><a name="ANTS" id="ANTS"></a>WHITE ANTS</h3>

<h4>From 'Tropical Africa'</h4>

<p>The termite or white ant is a small insect, with a bloated,
yellowish-white body, and a somewhat large thorax, oblong-shaped, and
colored a disagreeable oily brown. The flabby, tallow-like body makes
this insect sufficiently repulsive, but it is for quite another reason
that the white ant is the worst abused of all living vermin in warm
countries. The termite lives almost exclusively upon wood; and the
moment a tree is cut or a log sawn for any economical purpose, this
insect is upon its track. One may never see the insect, possibly, in
the flesh, for it lives underground; but its ravages confront one at
every turn. You build your house perhaps, and for a few months fancy
you have pitched upon the one solitary site in the country where there
are no white ants. But one day suddenly the door-post totters, and
lintel and rafters come down together with a crash. You look at a
section of the wrecked timbers, and discover that the whole inside is
eaten clean away. The apparently solid logs of which the rest of the
house is built are now mere cylinders of bark, and through the
thickest of them you could push your little finger. Furniture, tables,
chairs, chests of drawers, everything made of wood, is inevitably
attacked, and in a single night a strong trunk is often riddled
through and through, and turned into matchwood. There is no limit, in
fact, to the depredation by these insects, and they will eat books, or
leather, or cloth, or anything; and in many parts of Africa I believe
if a man lay down to sleep with a wooden leg, it would be a heap of
sawdust in the morning. So much feared is this insect now, that no one
in certain parts of India and Africa ever attempts to travel with such
a thing as a wooden trunk. On the Tanganyika plateau I have camped on
ground which was as hard as adamant, and as innocent of white ants
apparently as the pavement of St. Paul's; and wakened next morning to
find a stout wooden box almost gnawed to pieces. Leather portmanteaus
share the same fate, and the only substances which seem to defy the
marauders are iron and tin.</p>

<p>But what has this to do with earth or with agriculture? The most
important point in the work of the white ant remains to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4906" id="Page_4906">[Pg 4906]</a></span>
noted. I have already said that the white ant is never seen. Why he
should have such a repugnance to being looked at is at first sight a
mystery, seeing that he himself is stone blind. But his coyness is
really due to the desire for self-protection; for the moment his juicy
body shows itself above ground there are a dozen enemies waiting to
devour it. And yet the white ant can never procure any food until it
comes above ground. Nor will it meet the case for the insect to come
to the surface under the shadow of night. Night in the tropics, so far
as animal life is concerned, is as the day. It is the great
feeding-time, the great fighting-time, the carnival of the carnivores,
and of all beasts, birds, and insects of prey, from the least to the
greatest. It is clear then that darkness is no protection to the white
ant; and yet without coming out of the ground it cannot live. How does
it solve the difficulty? It takes the ground out along with it. I have
seen white ants working on the top of a high tree, and yet they were
underground. They took up some of the ground with them to the
tree-top; just as the Esquimaux heap up snow, building it into the low
tunnel-huts in which they live, so the white ants collect earth, only
in this case not from the surface, but from some depth underneath the
ground, and plaster it into tunneled ways. Occasionally these run
along the ground, but more often mount in endless ramifications to the
top of trees, meandering along every branch and twig, and here and
there debouching into large covered chambers which occupy half the
girth of the trunk. Millions of trees in some districts are thus
fantastically plastered over with tubes, galleries, and chambers of
earth, and many pounds' weight of subsoil must be brought up for the
mining of even a single tree. The building material is conveyed by the
insects up a central pipe with which all the galleries communicate,
and which at the downward end connects with a series of subterranean
passages leading deep into the earth. The method of building the
tunnels and covered ways is as follows: At the foot of a tree the
tiniest hole cautiously opens in the ground close to the bark. A small
head appears, with a grain of earth clasped in its jaws. Against the
tree trunk this earth-grain is deposited, and the head is withdrawn.
Presently it reappears with another grain of earth; this is laid
beside the first, rammed tight against it, and again the builder
descends underground for more. The third grain is not placed against
the tree, but against the former grain; a fourth, a fifth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4907" id="Page_4907">[Pg 4907]</a></span>
and a sixth follow, and the plan of the foundation begins to suggest
itself as soon as these are in position. The stones or grains or
pellets of earth are arranged in a semicircular wall; the termite, now
assisted by three or four others, standing in the middle between the
sheltering wall and the tree, and working briskly with head and
mandible to strengthen the position. The wall in fact forms a small
moon-rampart, and as it grows higher and higher it soon becomes
evident that it is going to grow from a low battlement into a long
perpendicular tunnel running up the side of the tree. The workers,
safely ensconced inside, are now carrying up the structure with great
rapidity, disappearing in turn as soon as they have laid their stone,
and rushing off to bring up another. The way in which the building is
done is extremely curious, and one could watch the movement of these
wonderful little masons by the hour. Each stone as it is brought to
the top is first of all covered with mortar. Of course, without this
the whole tunnel would crumble into dust before reaching the height of
half an inch; but the termite pours over the stone a moist sticky
secretion, turning the grain round and round with its mandibles until
the whole is covered with slime. Then it places the stone with great
care upon the top of the wall, works it about vigorously for a moment
or two till it is well jammed into its place, and then starts off
instantly for another load.</p>

<p>Peering over the growing wall, one soon discovers one, two, or more
termites of a somewhat larger build, considerably longer, and with a
very different arrangement of the parts of the head, and especially of
the mandibles. These important-looking individuals saunter about the
rampart in the most leisurely way, but yet with a certain air of
business, as if perhaps the one was the master of works and the other
the architect. But closer observation suggests that they are in no
wise superintending operations, nor in any immediate way contributing
to the structure, for they take not the slightest notice either of the
workers or the works. They are posted there in fact as sentries; and
there they stand, or promenade about, at the mouth of every tunnel,
like Sister Anne, to see if anybody is coming. Sometimes somebody does
come, in the shape of another ant; the real ant this time, not the
defenseless <i>Neuropteron</i>, but some valiant and belted knight
from the warlike <i>Formicid&aelig;</i>. Singly or in troops, this
rapacious little insect, fearless in its chitinous coat of mail,
charges down the tree trunk, its antenn&aelig; waving defiance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4908" id="Page_4908">[Pg 4908]</a></span>
to the enemy and its cruel mandibles thirsting for termite blood. The
worker white ant is a poor defenseless creature, and blind and
unarmed, would fall an immediate prey to these well-drilled banditti,
who forage about in every tropical forest in unnumbered legion. But at
the critical moment, like Goliath from the Philistines, the soldier
termite advances to the fight. With a few sweeps of its scythe-like
jaws it clears the ground, and while the attacking party is carrying
off its dead, the builders, unconscious of the fray, quietly continue
their work. To every hundred workers in a white-ant colony, which
numbers many thousands of individuals, there are perhaps two of these
fighting men. The division of labor here is very wonderful; and the
fact that besides these two specialized forms there are in every nest
two other kinds of the same insect, the kings and queens, shows the
remarkable height to which civilization in these communities has
attained.</p>

<p>But where is this tunnel going to, and what object have the insects in
view in ascending this lofty tree? Thirty feet from the ground, across
innumerable forks, at the end of a long branch, are a few feet of dead
wood. How the ants know it is there, how they know its sap has dried
up, and that it is now fit for the termites' food, is a mystery.
Possibly they do not know, and are only prospecting on the chance. The
fact that they sometimes make straight for the decaying limb argues in
these instances a kind of definite instinct; but on the other hand,
the fact that in most cases the whole tree, in every branch and limb,
is covered with termite tunnels, would show perhaps that they work
most commonly on speculation, while the number of abandoned tunnels,
ending on a sound branch in a <i>cul de sac</i>, proves how often they must
suffer the usual disappointments of all such adventurers. The extent
to which these insects carry on their tunneling is quite incredible,
until one has seen it in nature with his own eyes. The tunnels are
perhaps about the thickness of a small-sized gas-pipe, but there are
junctions here and there of large dimensions, and occasionally patches
of earthwork are found, embracing nearly the whole trunk for some
feet. The outside of these tunnels, which are never quite straight,
but wander irregularly along stem and branch, resembles in texture a
coarse sandpaper; and the color, although this naturally varies with
the soil, is usually a reddish brown. The quantity of earth
and mud plastered over a single tree is often enormous; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4909" id="Page_4909">[Pg 4909]</a></span>
when one thinks that it is not only an isolated specimen here and there that is
frescoed in this way, but often all the trees of a forest, some idea
will be formed of the magnitude of the operations of these insects,
and the extent of their influence upon the soil which they are thus
ceaselessly transporting from underneath the ground.</p>

<p>In traveling through the great forests of the Rocky Mountains or of
the Western States, the broken branches and fallen trunks, strewing
the ground breast-high with all sorts of decaying litter, frequently
make locomotion impossible. To attempt to ride through these Western
forests, with their meshwork of interlocked branches and decaying
trunks, is often out of the question, and one has to dismount and drag
his horse after him as if he were clambering through a wood-yard. But
in an African forest not a fallen branch is seen. One is struck at
first at a certain clean look about the great forests of the interior,
a novel and unaccountable cleanness, as if the forest bed was
carefully swept and dusted daily by unseen elves. And so indeed it is.
Scavengers of a hundred kinds remove decaying animal matter, from the
carcass of a fallen elephant to the broken wing of a gnat; eating it,
or carrying it out of sight and burying it in the deodorizing earth.
And these countless millions of termites perform a similar function
for the vegetable world, making away with all plants and trees, all
stems, twigs, and tissues, the moment the finger of decay strikes the
signal. Constantly in these woods one comes across what appear to be
sticks and branches and bundles of fagots, but when closely examined
they are seen to be mere casts in mud. From these hollow tubes, which
preserve the original form of the branch down to the minutest knot or
fork, the ligneous tissue is often entirely removed, while others are
met with in all stages of demolition. There is the section of an
actual specimen, which is not yet completely destroyed, and from which
the mode of attack may be easily seen. The insects start apparently
from two centres. One company attacks the inner bark, which is the
favorite morsel, leaving the coarse outer bark untouched, or more
usually replacing it with grains of earth, atom by atom, as they eat
it away. The inner bark is gnawed off likewise as they go along, but
the woody tissue beneath is allowed to remain, to form a protective
sheath for the second company, who begin work at the centre. This
second contingent eats its way outward and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4910" id="Page_4910">[Pg 4910]</a></span>
onward, leaving a thin tube of the outer wood to the last, as props to
the mine, till they have finished the main excavation. When a fallen
trunk lying upon the ground is the object of attack, the outer
cylinder is frequently left quite intact, and it is only when one
tries to drag it off to his camp-fire that he finds to his disgust
that he is dealing with a mere hollow tube, a few lines in thickness,
filled up with mud.</p>

<p>But the works above ground represent only a part of the labors of
these slow-moving but most industrious of creatures. The arboreal
tubes are only the prolongation of a much more elaborate system of
subterranean tunnels, which extend over large areas and mine the earth
sometimes to a depth of many feet or even yards.</p>

<p>The material excavated from these underground galleries and from the
succession of domed chambers&mdash;used as nurseries or granaries&mdash;to which
they lead, has to be thrown out upon the surface. And it is from these
materials that the huge ant-hills are reared, which form so
distinctive a feature of the African landscape. These heaps and mounds
are so conspicuous that they may be seen for miles, and so numerous
are they and so useful as cover to the sportsman, that without them in
certain districts hunting would be impossible. The first things,
indeed, to strike the traveler in entering the interior are the mounds
of the white ant, now dotting the plain in groups like a small
cemetery, now rising into mounds, singly or in clusters, each thirty
or forty feet in diameter and ten or fifteen in height; or again,
standing out against the sky like obelisks, their bare sides carved
and fluted into all sorts of fantastic shapes. In India these
ant-heaps seldom attain a height of more than a couple of feet, but in
Central Africa they form veritable hills, and contain many tons of
earth. The brick houses of the Scotch mission-station on Lake Nyassa
have all been built out of a single ants' nest, and the quarry from
which the material has been derived forms a pit beside the settlement
some dozen feet in depth. A supply of bricks as large again could
probably still be taken from this convenient depot; and the
missionaries on Lake Tanganyika and onwards to Victoria Nyanza have
been similarly indebted to the labors of the termites. In South Africa
the Zulus and Kaffirs pave all their huts with white-ant earth; and
during the Boer war our troops in Pretoria, by scooping out the
interior from the smaller beehive-shaped ant-heaps and covering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4911" id="Page_4911">[Pg 4911]</a></span>
the top with clay, constantly used them as ovens. These ant-heaps may be
said to abound over the whole interior of Africa, and there are
several distinct species. The most peculiar, as well as the most
ornate, is a small variety from one to two feet in height, which
occurs in myriads along the shores of Lake Tanganyika. It is built in
symmetrical tiers, and resembles a pile of small rounded hats, one
above another, the rims depending like eaves, and sheltering the body
of the hill from rain. To estimate the amount of earth per acre raised
from the waterline of the subsoil by white ants, would not in some
districts be an impossible task; and it would be found probably that
the quantity at least equaled that manipulated annually in temperate
regions by the earthworm.</p>

<p>These mounds, however, are more than mere waste-heaps. Like the
corresponding region underground, they are built into a meshwork of
tunnels, galleries, and chambers, where the social interests of the
community are attended to. The most spacious of these chambers,
usually far underground, is very properly allocated to the head of the
society, the queen. The queen termite is a very rare insect, and as
there are seldom more than one or at most two to a colony, and as the
royal apartments are hidden far in the earth, few persons have ever
seen a queen; and indeed most, if they did happen to come across it,
from its very singular appearance would refuse to believe that it had
any connection with white ants. It possesses indeed the true termite
head, but there the resemblance to the other members of the family
stops; for the size of the head bears about the same proportion to the
rest of the body as does the tuft on his Glengarry bonnet to a
six-foot Highlander. The phenomenal corpulence of the royal body in
the case of the queen termite is possibly due in part to want of
exercise; for once seated upon her throne, she never stirs to the end
of her days. She lies there, a large, loathsome, cylindrical package,
two or three inches long, in shape like a sausage, and as white as a
bolster. Her one duty in life is to lay eggs; and it must be confessed
she discharges her function with complete success, for in a single day
her progeny often amounts to many thousands, and for months this
enormous fecundity never slackens. The body increases slowly in size,
and through the transparent skin the long folded ovary may be seen,
with the eggs, impelled by a peristaltic motion, passing onward for
delivery to the workers, who are waiting to carry them to the nurseries, where they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4912" id="Page_4912">[Pg 4912]</a></span>
are hatched. Assiduous attention meantime is paid to the queen by
other workers, who feed her diligently, with much self-denial stuffing
her with morsel after morsel from their own jaws. A guard of honor in
the shape of a few of the larger soldier ants is also in attendance,
as a last and almost unnecessary precaution. In addition finally to
the soldiers, workers, and queen, the royal chamber has also one other
inmate&mdash;the king. He is a very ordinary-looking insect, about the
same size as the soldiers, but the arrangement of the parts of the
head and body is widely different, and like the queen he is furnished
with eyes.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">t seems to be the mission of many writers to illuminate contemporary
literature and so to light the way for future students, rather than to
make any vital contribution to the achievement of their time. Such
writers reflect the culture of their own day and represent its ideals;
and although their creative work may be slight, their loss to
literature would be serious. Among these lesser men stands that
sincere poet, Drummond of Hawthornden. In Scotland under the Stuarts,
when the vital energy of the land was concentrated upon politics and
theology, native literature was reduced to a mere reflection of the
pre-Spenserian classicism of England. Into this waste of correct
mediocrity entered the poetry of William Drummond, an avowed and
enthusiastic follower of the Elizabethan school, a finished scholar,
one of the typical Scottish gentlemen who were then making Scottish
history. Courtier and trifler though he was, however, he showed
himself so true a poet of nature that his felicities of phrase seem to
anticipate the sensuous realism of Keats and his successors.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">William Drummond</span></span>
</div>

<p>William Drummond, born in 1585, was a cadet of the historic house
which in 1357 gave in marriage to King Robert III. the beautiful
Annabella Drummond, who was destined to become the ancestress of the
royal Stuarts of Scotland and England. In his own day the family,
whose head was the Earl of Perth, was powerful in Scottish affairs,
and the history of the clan Drummond would be largely a history of the
events which led to the Protectorate. Throughout the storm and stress
that preceded the civil war Drummond was a loyalist, though at one
time he appeared to be identified with the Covenanters. His literary
influence, which was considerable, was always thrown on the side of
the King, while the term "Drummondism" was a popular synonym for the
conservative policy. Throughout the struggle, however, Drummond seems
to have been forced into activity by circumstances rather than by choice.
He had the instincts of a recluse and a scholar. He delighted in the society
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4914" id="Page_4914">[Pg 4914]</a></span>
of literary men, and he was much engrossed in philosophical speculations.</p>

<p>In spite of the difficulties of distance, he managed to keep abreast
of the thought of literary London, the London of Drayton and Webster,
of Beaumont, Fletcher, Massinger, and Ford. His chief satisfaction was
to know that his own work was not unacceptable to this brilliant
group, and one of the great pleasures of his life was a visit from Ben
Jonson, who, making a walking tour to Scotland, found at Hawthornden
that congenial hospitality in which his soul delighted. Of this famous
visit, as of other important events, Drummond kept a record, in which
he set down his guest's behavior, opinions, and confidential sayings.
Warmly as he admired Jonson's genius, he found his personality
oppressive, and intrusted his criticisms to his diary. When this was
published, more than a century later, the gentle Scot was accused of
bad taste, breach of confidence, and disloyalty to friendship. But his
defense lies in the fact that the book was meant for no eyes but his
own, and that the intimacy and candor of its revelations were intended
to preserve his recollections of a memorable experience.</p>

<p>If his environment was not entirely favorable to literary excellences,
it is yet very likely that Drummond developed the full measure
of his gift. He expressed the spirit of the more imaginative
generation which succeeded a hard and fettered predecessor, and it
is for this that literature owes him its peculiar debt.</p>

<p>His career began in his twenty-ninth year with the publication of
an elegy on the death of Henry, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I.
This poem, under the title 'Tears on the Death of Moeliades,' appeared
in 1613, and reached a third edition within a twelvemonth.
Its two hundred lines show the finished versification of the scholar,
with much poetic grace. It was a product of the Spenserian school,
and emphasized the fact that the representative literature of the land
had abandoned the Scottish dialect for English forms. Drummond's
second volume of poems commemorated the death of his wife and his
love of her. It is in this work that the ultimate mood of the poet
appears. Much beauty of form, a delightful sensitiveness to nature, a
luxuriance of color, and a finely tempered thoughtfulness pervade the
poems. His next production, celebrating the visit of James I. to his
native land, was entitled 'Forth Feasting,' and represented the
Forth and all its borders as rejoicing in the presence of their King.
To the reader of to-day the panegyric sounds fulsome and the poetry
stilted, and the once famous book has now merely an archaic interest.</p>

<p>Drummond's reputation is based upon the 'Poems,' and upon the
Jeremy-Taylor-like 'Cypress Grove,' published in 1623 in connection
with the religious verses called 'Flowers of Sion.' 'Cypress Grove'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4915" id="Page_4915">[Pg 4915]</a></span>
is an essay on death, akin in spirit to the religious temper of the
Middle Ages, and in philosophic breadth to the diviner mood of Plato.
Only a mind of a high order would have conceived so beautiful and
lofty a meditation on the Final Mystery. This brief essay marks the
utmost reach of Drummond's mind, and shows the strength of that serene
spirituality, which could thus hold its way undisturbed by the
sectarian bitterness that fixed a great gulf between England and
Scotland. 'The History of the Five Jameses,' which Drummond was ten
years in compiling and which was not published until six years after
his death, added nothing to his reputation. It lacked alike the
diligent minuteness of the chronicler and the broader view of the
historian. Many minor papers on the state of religion and politics,
chief of which is the political tract 'Irene,' show Drummond's
aggressive interest in contemporary affairs. It is not generally known
that this gentle scholar was also an inventor of military engines. In
1626 Charles I. engaged him to produce sixteen machines and "not a few
inventions besides." The biographers have remained curiously ignorant
of this phase of his activity, but the State papers show that the King
named him "our faithful subject, William Drummond of Hawthornden." He
died in 1649, his death being hastened, it was said, by his passion of
grief over the martyrdom of King Charles.</p>

<h3><a name="DEATH" id="DEATH"></a>ON DEATH</h3>

<h4>From 'Cypress Grove'</h4>

<p>Death is a piece of the order of this all, a part of the life of this
world; for while the world is the world, some creatures must die and
others take life. Eternal things are raised far above this orb of
generation and corruption where the First Matter, like a still flowing
and ebbing sea, with diverse waves but the same water, keepeth a
restless and never tiring current; what is below in the universality
of its kind doth not in itself abide.... If thou dost complain there
shall be a time in the which thou shalt not be, why dost thou not too
grieve that there was a time in which thou wast not, and so that thou
art not as old as the enlivening planet of Time?... The excellent
fabric of the universe itself shall one day suffer ruin, or change
like ruin, and poor earthlings, thus to be handled, complain!</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_DRYDEN" id="JOHN_DRYDEN"></a>JOHN DRYDEN</h2>

<h4>(1631-1700)</h4>

<h4>BY THOMAS R. LOUNSBURY</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 89px;">
<img src="images/capj257.png" width="89" height="91" alt="J" title="J" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ohn Dryden, the foremost man of letters of the period following the
Restoration, was born at Aldwinkle, a village of Northamptonshire, on
August 9th, 1631. He died May 1st, 1700. His life was therefore coeval
with the closing period of the fierce controversies which culminated
in the civil war and the triumph of the Parliamentary party; that, in
turn, to be followed successively by the iron rule of Cromwell, by the
restoration of the exiled Stuarts, and the reactionary tendencies in
politics that accompanied that event; and finally with the effectual
exclusion from the throne of this same family by the revolution of
1688, leaving behind, however, to their successors a smoldering
Jacobite hostility that perpetually plotted the overthrow of the new
government and later broke out twice into open revolt. All these
changes of fortune, with their changes of opinion, are faithfully
reflected in the productions of Dryden. To understand him thoroughly
requires therefore an intimate familiarity with the civil and
religious movements which characterize the whole period. Equally also
do his writings, both creative and critical, represent the revolution
of literary taste that took place in the latter half of the
seventeenth century. It was while he was in the midst of his
intellectual activity that French canons of criticism became largely
the accepted rules, by which the value of English productions was
tested. This was especially true of the drama. The study of Dryden is
accordingly a study of the political and literary history of his times
to an extent that is correspondingly true of no other English author
before or since.</p>

<p>His family, both on the father's and the mother's side, was in full
sympathy with the party opposed to the court. The son was educated
at Westminster, then under the mastership of Richard Busby,
whose relentless use of the rod has made his name famous in that
long line of flagellants who have been at the head of the great English
public schools. From Westminster he went to Trinity College,
Cambridge. There he received the degree of A. B. in January 1654.
Later in that same decade&mdash;the precise date is not known&mdash;he took
up his residence in London; and in London the rest of his life was
almost entirely spent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4920" id="Page_4920">[Pg 4920]</a></span>
Dryden's first published literary effort appeared in a little volume
made up of thirty-three elegies, by various authors, on the death of
a youth of great promise who had been educated at Westminster.
This was Lord Hastings, the eldest son of the Earl of Huntingdon.
He had died of the small-pox. Dryden's contribution was written in
1649, and consisted of but little over a hundred lines. No one expects
great verse from a boy of eighteen; but the most extravagant
anticipations of sorry performance will fail to come up to the reality
of the wretchedness which was here attained. It was in words like
these that the future laureate bewailed the death of the young nobleman
and depicted the disease of which he died:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Was there no milder way but the small-pox,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The very filthiness of Pandora's box?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So many spots, like naeves, our Venus soil?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">One jewel set off with so many a foil?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blisters with pride swelled, which through his flesh did sprout<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Like rosebuds, stuck in the lily-skin about.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Each little pimple had a tear in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To wail the fault its rising did commit;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which, rebel-like, with its own lord at strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thus made an insurrection 'gainst his life.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or were these gems sent to adorn his skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The cabinet of a richer soul within?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">No comet need foretell his change drew on,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whose corps might seem a constellation."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Criticism cannot be rendered sufficiently vituperative to characterize
properly such a passage. It is fuller of conceits than ever Cowley
crowded into the same space; and lines more crabbed and inharmonious
Donne never succeeded in perpetrating. Its production upsets
all principles of prophecy. The wretchedest of poetasters can
take courage, when he contemplates the profundity of the depth out
of which uprose the greatest poet of his time.</p>

<span class="caption">JOHN DRYDEN.</span>
</div>

<p>Dryden is, in fact, an example of that somewhat rare class of
writers who steadily improve with advancing years. Most poets write
their best verse before middle life. Many of them after that time go
through a period of decline, and sometimes of rapid decline; and if
they live to reach old age, they add to the quantity of their production
without sensibly increasing its value. This general truth is conspicuously
untrue of Dryden. His first work gave no promise of his
future excellence, and it was by very slow degrees that he attained
to the mastery of his art. But the older he grew, the better he
wrote; and the volume published a few months before his death, and
largely composed almost under its shadow, so far from showing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4921" id="Page_4921">[Pg 4921]</a></span>
slightest sign of failing power, contains a great deal of the best
poetry he ever produced.</p>

<p>As Dryden's relatives were Puritans, and some of them held place
under the government, it was natural that upon coming to London
he should attach himself to that party. Accordingly it is no surprise
to find him duly mourning the death of the great Protector in certain
'Heroic Stanzas Consecrated to the Memory of Oliver Cromwell.'
The first edition bears the date of 1659, and so far as we know, the
production was Dryden's second venture in poetry. It was written
in the measure of Davenant's 'Gondibert,' and is by no means a poor
piece of work, though it has been sometimes so styled. It certainly
pays not simply a high but a discerning tribute to the genius of
Cromwell. Before two years had gone by, we find its author greeting
the return of Charles with effusive loyalty, and with predictions
of prosperity and honor to attend his reign, which events were soon
woefully to belie. The poet has been severely censured for this
change of attitude. It is a censure which might be bestowed with as
much propriety upon the whole population of England. The joyful
expectations to which he gave utterance were almost universal; and
no other charge can well be brought against him than that he had
the ability and took the occasion to express sentiments which were
felt by nearly the entire nation.</p>

<p>From this time on, Dryden appears more and more in the public eye, and
slowly but steadily forged his way to the front as the representative
man of letters of his time. In 1670 he was appointed to the two
distinct offices of poet laureate and historiographer royal.
Thenceforward his relations with the court became close, and so they
did not cease to be until the expulsion of James II. In 1683 he
received a further mark of royal favor, in being made collector of
customs of the port of London. In the political controversies which
subsequently arose, Dryden's writings faithfully represented the
sentiments of the side he had chosen, and expressed their prejudices
and aversions not merely with force but also with virulence. His first
literary activity, however, was on neutral ground. After eighteen
years of compulsory closing, the Restoration opened wide once more the
doors of the theatre. Dryden, like every one else possessed of
literary ability, began to write for the stage. His first play, a
comedy entitled 'The Wild Gallant,' was brought out in February 1663;
and for the eighteen years following, it was compositions of such
nature that occupied the main portion of his literary life. During
that time he produced wholly or in part twenty-two comedies and
tragedies. His pieces must from the outset have met with a fair degree
of success, otherwise the King's Company would not have entered into a
contract with him, as it did in 1667, to furnish for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4922" id="Page_4922">[Pg 4922]</a></span>
them each year a fixed number of plays, in consideration of his receiving
a certain share of the profits of the theatre.</p>

<p>Yet it cannot be said that Dryden was in any respect a dramatist
of a high order. As a writer of comedy he was not only inferior to
contemporaries and immediate successors like Wycherley, Congreve,
Vanbrugh, and Farquhar, but in certain ways he was surpassed by
Shadwell, the very man whom he himself has consigned to a disagreeable
immortality as the hero of the 'MacFlecknoe.' His comedies
are not merely full of obscenity,&mdash;which seems to have been a necessary
ingredient to suit them to the taste of the age,&mdash;but they are
full of a peculiarly disagreeable obscenity. One of his worst offenses in
this direction, and altogether his most impudent one, was his adaptation
for the stage of Shakespeare's 'Tempest.' The two plays are
worth reading together for the sake of seeing how easily a pure and
perfect creation of genius can be vulgarized in language and spirit
almost beyond the possibility of recognition. In his tragedies,
however, Dryden was much more successful. Yet even these, in spite
of the excellence of occasional passages, do not attain to a high rank.
Indeed, thought and expression are at times extravagant, not to say
stilted, to an extent which afterward led him himself to make them
the subject of ridicule. It was in them, however, during these years
that he perfected by degrees his mastery of heroic verse, of which
later he was to display the capabilities in a way that had never previously
been seen and has never since been surpassed.</p>

<p>A controversy in regard to the proper method of composing plays
brought forward Dryden, at an early period in his literary career, as
a writer of prose. In this he at once attained unusual eminence. In
him appear for the first time united the two characters of poet and
of critic. Ben Jonson had in a measure preceded him in this respect;
but Jonson's criticism was not so much devoted to the examination
of general principles as to the exposure of the hopeless, helpless
obtuseness of the men who had a different opinion of his works from
what he himself entertained. The questions discussed by Dryden were
of a more general nature. With the Stuarts had come in French
literary tastes and French literary methods. The age was supposed
to be too refined to be pleased with what had satisfied the coarse
palates of preceding generations. In stage-writing in particular, the
doctrine of the unities, almost uniformly violated by Shakespeare and
most of the Elizabethans, was now held up as the only correct
method of composition that could be employed by any writer who
sought to conform to the true principles of art. Along with this
came the substitution in the drama of rhyme for blank verse. Upon
the comparative merits of these two as employed in tragedy, arose
the first controversy in which Dryden was engaged. This one was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4923" id="Page_4923">[Pg 4923]</a></span>
with his brother-in-law, Sir Robert Howard; for in 1663 Dryden had
become the husband of the daughter of the Earl of Berkshire, thus
marrying, as Pope expressed it, "misery in a noble wife." Dryden
was an advocate of rhyme; and the controversy on this point began
with the publication in 1668 of his 'Essay of Dramatic Poesy.' It
was afterward carried on by both parties, in prefaces to the plays
they successively published. The prefaces to these productions regularly
became later the place where Dryden laid down his critical
doctrines on all points that engaged his attention; and whether we
agree with his views or not, we are always sure to be charmed with
the manner in which they are expressed.</p>

<p>In 1667 Dryden published a long poem entitled 'Annus Mirabilis.'
It was in the same measure as the stanzas on Oliver Cromwell. It
gave him a good deal of reputation at the time; but though it is far
from being a despicable performance, few there are now who read it
and still fewer who re-read it. Far different has been the fate of
his next work. It was not until 1681, when England was beginning
to emerge slowly from the excitement and agitation growing out of
the alleged Popish plot, that he brought out his 'Absalom and Achitophel,'
without question the greatest combined poetical and political
satire to be found in our tongue. Here it was that for the first time
he fully displayed his mastery over heroic verse. The notion once
so widely prevalent&mdash;for the vogue of which, indeed, Dryden himself
is mainly responsible&mdash;that Waller and Denham brought this
verse to perfection, it now requires both extensive and special ignorance
of our earlier authors to entertain; but on the other hand,
there is no question that he himself imparted to the line a variety,
vigor, and sustained majesty of movement such as the verse in its
modern form had never previously received. There is therefore a
fairly full measure of truth in the lines in which he was characterized
by Pope:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Waller was smooth; but Dryden taught to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The varying verse, the full resounding line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long majestic march and energy divine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines of Pope, it may be added, exemplify purposely two peculiarities
of Dryden's versification,&mdash;the occasional use of the triplet
instead of the regular couplet, and of the Alexandrine, or line of six
feet, in place of the usual line of five.</p>

<p>The poem is largely an attack upon the Earl of Shaftesbury,
who in it bears the title of Achitophel. The portrayal of this statesman,
which is given in this volume, is ample evidence of that skill of
the poet in characterization which has made the pictures he drew
immortal. Perhaps even more effective was the description of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4924" id="Page_4924">[Pg 4924]</a></span>
Duke of Buckingham, under the designation of Zimri. For attacking
that nobleman Dryden had both political and personal reasons. Buckingham
had now joined the opponents of the court. Ten years previously
the poet himself had been brought by him on the stage, with
the aid of others, in the play called "The Rehearsal." His usual
actions had been mimicked, his usual expressions had been put into
the mouth of the character created to represent him, who was styled
Bayes. This title had been given him because Dryden figuratively
wore the bays, or laurel, as poet laureate. The name henceforward
stuck. Dryden's turn had now come; and it was in these following
lines that he drew the unfaded and fadeless picture of this nobleman,
whose reputation even then was notorious rather than famous,
and whose intellect was motley-minded rather than versatile:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some of their chiefs were princes of the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the front rank of these did Zimri stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man so various that he seemed to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one, but all mankind's epitome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was everything by starts and nothing long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the course of one revolving moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blest madman, who could every hour employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With something new to wish or to enjoy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Railing and praising were his usual themes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both, to show his judgment, in extremes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So over-violent or over-civil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That every man with him was God or Devil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In squandering wealth was his peculiar art:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing went unrewarded but desert.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beggared by fools whom still he found too late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had his jest, and they had his estate."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As an example of the loftier and more majestic style occasionally
found in this poem, is the powerful appeal of Achitophel to Absalom.
The latter, it is to be said, stands for the Duke of Monmouth, the
eldest of the illegitimate sons of Charles II. Him many of the
so-called country party, now beginning to be styled Whigs, were
endeavoring to have recognized as the next successor to the throne, in
place of the Roman Catholic brother of the king, James, Duke of York.
As a favorite son of the monarch, he, though then in opposition, is
treated tenderly by Dryden throughout; and this feeling is plainly
visible in the opening of the address to him put into the mouth of
Achitophel, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4925" id="Page_4925">[Pg 4925]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Auspicious prince, at whose nativity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some royal planet ruled the southern sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy longing country's darling and desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cloudy pillar and their guardian fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their second Moses, whose extended wand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divides the seas and shows the promised land,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The young men's vision and the old men's dream,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee savior, thee the nation's vows confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never satisfied with seeing, bless."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dryden followed up the attack upon Shaftesbury with a poem entitled
'The Medal.' This satire, which appeared in March 1682, was called
forth by the action of the partisans of the Whig leader in having a
medal struck commemorating his release from the Tower, after the grand
jury had thrown out the charge of treason which had been brought
against him. Both of these pieces were followed by a host of replies.
Some of them did not refrain from personal attack, which indeed had a
certain justification in the poet's own violence of denunciation. The
most abusive of these was a poem by Thomas Shadwell, entitled 'The
Medal of John Bayes.' Such persons as fancy Dryden's subsequent
punishment of that dramatist unwarranted in its severity should in
justice read this ferociously scurrilous diatribe, in which every
charge against the poet that malice or envy had concocted and rumor
had set afloat, was here industriously raked together; and to the
muck-heap thus collected, the intimacy of previous acquaintance was
doubtless enabled to contribute its due quota of malignant assertion
and more malignant insinuation. Shadwell was soon supplied, however,
with ample reason to regret his action. Dryden's first and best known
rejoinder is 'MacFlecknoe, or a Satire on the True Blue Protestant
Poet T. S.' This production has always had the reputation in
literature of being the severest personal satire in the language; but
it requires now for its appreciation an intimate acquaintance with
Shadwell's plays, which very few possess. It is further disfigured in
places by a coarseness from which, indeed, none of the poet's writings
were certain to be free. Its general spirit can be indicated by a
brief extract from its opening paragraph. Flecknoe, it is to be said,
was a feeble poet who had died a few years before. He is here
represented as having long reigned over the kingdom of dullness, but
knowing that his end was close at hand, determines to settle the
succession to the State. Accordingly he fixes upon his son Shadwell as
the one best fitted to take his place in ruling over the realm of
nonsense, and in continuing the war with wit and sense. The
announcement of his intention he begins in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4926" id="Page_4926">[Pg 4926]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"&mdash;Tis resolved, for Nature pleads that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should only rule who most resembles me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadwell alone my perfect image bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mature in dullness from his tender years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadwell alone of all my sons is he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stands confirmed in full stupidity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest to some faint meaning make pretense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Shadwell never deviates into sense."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Far more bitter, however, was the renewed attack which a month
later Dryden inserted in the two hundred lines he contributed to the
continuation of 'Absalom and Achitophel' that was written by Nahum
Tate. In this second part, which came out in November 1682, he devoted
himself in particular to two of his opponents, Settle and Shadwell,
under the names respectively of Doeg and Og&mdash;"two fools," he
says, in his energetic way,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"That crutch their feeble sense on verse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who by my Muse to all succeeding times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall live in spite of their own doggerel rhymes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of Settle, whose poetry was possessed of much smoothness but
little sense, he spoke in a tone of contemptuous good-nature, though
the object of the attack must certainly have deemed the tender mercies
of Dryden to be cruel. It was in this way he was described, to
quote a few lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Spiteful he is not, though he wrote a satire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For still there goes some thinking to ill-nature.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him be gallows-free by my consent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing suffer, since he nothing meant;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanging supposes human soul and reason,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This animal's below committing treason:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he be hanged who never could rebel?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's a preferment for Achitophel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him rail on; let his invective Muse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have four-and-twenty letters to abuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which if he jumbles to one line of sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indict him of a capital offense."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it was not till he came to the portraiture of Shadwell that he
gave full vent to the ferocity of his satire. He taunted him with the
unwieldiness of his bulk, the grossness of his habits, with his want
of wealth, and finally closed up with some lines into which he concentrated
all the venom of his previous attacks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Refinement of tone is not the distinguishing characteristic of satire
of this sort. It does not attack its object by delicate insinuation or
remote suggestion. It operates by heavy downright blows which
crush by the mere weight and power of the stroke. There was in
truth in those days a certain brutality not only permitted but expected
in the way men spoke of each other, and Dryden conformed
in this as in other respects to the manners and methods of his age.
But of its kind the attack is perfect. The blows of a bludgeon which
make of the victim a shapeless mass kill as effectively as the steel
or poison which leaves every feature undisturbed, and to the common
apprehension it serves to render the killing more manifest. At any
rate, so long as a person has been done to death, it makes comparatively
little difference how the death was brought about; and the
object in this instance of Dryden's attack, though a man of no mean
abilities, has never recovered from the demolition which his reputation
then underwent.</p>

<p>In 1685 Charles II. died, and his brother James ascended the throne.
In the following year Dryden went over to the Roman Catholic
Church. No act of his life has met with severer censure. Nor can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4928" id="Page_4928">[Pg 4928]</a></span>
there be any doubt that the time he took to change his religion
afforded ground for distrusting the sincerity of his motives. A king
was on the throne who was straining every nerve to bring the Church
of England once more under the sway of the Church of Rome. Obviously
the adoption of the latter faith would recommend the poet to
the favor of the bigoted monarch, and tend to advance his personal
interests. There is no wonder, therefore, that he should at the time
have been accused of being actuated by the unworthiest of reasons,
and that the charge should continue to be repeated to our day. Yet
a close study of Dryden's life and writings indicates that the step he
took was a natural if not an inevitable outcome of the processes
through which his opinions had been passing. He had been early
trained in the strict tenets of the Puritan party. From these he had
been carried over to the loose beliefs and looser life that followed
everywhere hard upon the Restoration. By the sentiments then prevailing
he was profoundly affected. Nothing in the writings of the
first half of his literary life is more marked&mdash;not even his flings at
matrimony&mdash;than the scoffing way in which he usually spoke of the
clergy. His tone towards them is almost always contemptuous, where
it is not positively vituperative. His famous political satire began
with this line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In pious times, ere priestcraft did begin;"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and a little later in the course of the same poem he observed that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fraud was used, the sacrificer's trade,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the "sacrificer" here denoting the priest. This feeling toward the
clergy never in truth deserted him entirely. But no one who reads
carefully his 'Religio Laici,' a poem published in 1682, can fail to
perceive that even then he had not only drifted far away from the
faith of his childhood, but had begun to be tormented and perplexed
by the insoluble problems connected with the life and destiny of
man, and with his relations to his Creator. The subject was not
likely to weigh less heavily upon him in the years that followed.
To Dryden, as to many before and since, it may have seemed the
easiest method of deliverance from the difficulties in which he found
himself involved, to cast the burden of doubts which disquieted the
mind and depressed the heart, upon a Church that undertakes to
assume the whole responsibility for the man's future on condition of
his yielding to it an unquestioning faith in the present.</p>

<p>An immediate result of his conversion was the production in 1687 of
one of his most deservedly famous poems, 'The Hind and the Panther.'
He began it with the idea of assisting in bringing about the
reconciliation between the Panther, typifying the Church of England,
and the Hind, typifying the Church of Rome. It is apparent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4929" id="Page_4929">[Pg 4929]</a></span>
that before he finished it he saw that the project was hopeless. It is a
poem of over twenty-five hundred lines, of which the opening up to
line 150 is printed in this volume. Part of the passage here cited
contains, without professing it as an object, and probably without
intending it, the best defense that could be made for his change of
religion. The production in its entirety is remarkable for the skill
which its author displayed in carrying on an argument in verse. In
this he certainly had no superior among poets, perhaps no equal. The
work naturally created a great sensation in those days of fierce
political and religious controversy. Both it and its writer were made
the object of constant attack. A criticism, in particular, appeared
upon it in the shape of a dialogue in prose with snatches of verse
interspersed. It is usually known by the title of 'The Town Mouse and
the Country Mouse,' and was exalted at the time by unreasoning
partisanship into a wonderful performance. Even to the present day,
this dreary specimen of polemics is described as a very witty work by
those who have never struggled to read it. It was the production of
Charles Montagu, the future Earl of Halifax, and of Matthew Prior. A
story too is still constantly repeated that Dryden was much hurt by
the attacks of these two young men, to whom he had been kind, and wept
over their ingratitude. If he shed any tears at all upon the occasion,
they must have been due to the mortification he felt that any two
persons who had been admitted to his friendship should have been
guilty of twaddle so desperately tedious.</p>

<p>The flight of James and the accession of William and Mary threw
Dryden at once out of the favor of the court, upon which to a large
extent he had long depended for support. As a Jacobite he could
not take the oath of allegiance; but there is hardly any doubt that
under any circumstances he would have been deprived of the offices
of place and profit he held. In the laureateship he was succeeded by
his old antagonist Shadwell; and within a few years he saw the
dignity of the position still further degraded by the appointment to
it of Nahum Tate, one of the worst of the long procession of poetasters
who have filled it. Dryden henceforth belonged to the party out
of power. His feelings about his changed relations are shown plainly
in the fine epistle with which he consoled Congreve for the failure
of his comedy of the 'Double Dealer.' Yet displaced and unpensioned,
and sometimes the object of hostile attack, his literary supremacy
was more absolute than ever. All young authors, whether
Whigs or Tories, sought his society and courted his favor; and his
seat at Will's coffee-house was the throne from which he swayed the
literary sceptre of England.</p>

<p>After the revolution of 1688 Dryden gave himself entirely up to
authorship. He first turned to the stage; and between 1690 and 1694
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4930" id="Page_4930">[Pg 4930]</a></span>
he produced five plays. With the failure in the last-mentioned year
of his tragi-comedy called 'Love Triumphant,' he abandoned writing
for the theatre. The period immediately following he devoted mainly
to his translation of Virgil, which was published in 1697. It was
highly successful; but far more reputation came to him from a large
folio volume that was brought out in November 1699, under the title
of 'Fables.' Its contents consisted mainly of poetical narratives
founded upon certain stories of the 'Decameron,' and of the modernization
of some of the 'Canterbury Tales.' In certain ways these have
been his most successful pieces, and have made his name familiar to
successive generations of readers. Of the tales from Boccaccio, that
of 'Cymon and Iphigenia' is on the whole the most pleasing. The
modernizations of Chaucer were long regarded as superior to the
original; and though superior knowledge of the original has effectually
banished that belief, there is on the other hand no justification
for the derogatory terms which are now sometimes applied to Dryden's
versions.</p>

<p>The verse in this volume was preceded by a long critical essay in
prose. Many of its views, especially those about the language of
Chaucer, have been long discarded; but the criticism will always be
read with pleasure for the genial spirit and sound sense which pervade
it, and the unstudied ease with which it is written. Cowley
and Dryden are in fact the founders of modern English prose; and
the influence of the latter has been much greater than that of the
former, inasmuch as he touched upon a far wider variety of topics,
and for that reason obtained a far larger circle of readers in the
century following his death. There was also the same steady improvement
in Dryden's critical taste that there was in his poetical
expression. His admiration for Shakespeare constantly improved during
his whole life; and it is to be noticed that in what is generally
regarded as the best of his plays&mdash;'All for Love,' brought out in the
winter of 1677-78&mdash;he of his own accord abandoned rhyme for blank
verse.</p>

<p>The publication of the 'Fables' was Dryden's last appearance
before the public. In the following year he died, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey by the side of Chaucer and Cowley. After his
death his fame steadily increased instead of diminishing. For a long
period his superiority in his particular line was ungrudgingly conceded
by all, or if contested, was contested by Pope alone. His
poetry indeed is not of the highest kind, though usually infinitely
superior to that of his detractors. Still his excellences were those of
the intellect and not of the spirit. On the higher planes of thought
and feeling he rarely moves; to the highest he never aspires. The
nearest he ever approaches to the former is in his later work, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4931" id="Page_4931">[Pg 4931]</a></span>
religious emotion or religious zeal has lent to expression the aid of
its intensity. There is a striking example of this in the personal
references to his own experiences in the lines cited below from 'The
Hind and the Panther.' Something too of the same spirit can be
found, expressed in lofty language, in the following passage from the
same poem, descriptive of the unity of the Church of Rome as contrasted
with the numerous warring sects into which the Protestant
body is divided:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One in herself, not rent by schism, but sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entire, one solid shining diamond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not sparkles shattered into sects like you:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One is the Church, and must be to be true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One central principle of unity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As undivided, so from errors free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one in faith, so one in sanctity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus she, and none but she, the insulting rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heretics opposed from age to age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still when the giant brood invades her throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stoops from heaven and meets them half-way down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with paternal thunders vindicates her crown.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus one, thus pure, behold her largely spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the fair ocean from her mother-bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From east to west triumphantly she rides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All shores are watered by her wealthy tides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gospel sound diffused from Pole to Pole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where winds can carry and where waves can roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The selfsame doctrine of the sacred page<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conveyed to every clime, in every age."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But though Dryden's poetry is not of the highest class, it is of the
very highest kind in its class. Wherever the pure intellect comes into
play, there he is invariably excellent. There is never any weakness;
there is never any vagueness; there is never any deviation from the
true path into aimless digression. His words invariably go straight to
the mark, and not unfrequently with a directness and force that fully
merit the epithet of "burning" applied to them by the poet Gray.
His thoughts always rise naturally out of the matter in hand; and in
the treatment of the meanest subjects he is not only never mean, but
often falls without apparent effort into a felicity of phrase which
holds the attention and implants itself in the memory. The benefit
of exercise, for instance, is not a topic that can be deemed highly
poetical; but in his epistle on country life addressed to his cousin
John Driden, the moment he comes to speak of hunting and its salutary
results his expression at once leaves the commonplace, and embodies
the thought in these pointed lines:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"So lived our sires, ere doctors learned to kill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And multiply with theirs the weekly bill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first physicians by debauch were made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excess began, and sloth sustains the trade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But we their sons, a pampered race of men,<br /></span>

<p>In a similar way in 'Cymon and Iphigenia' the contempt which
Dryden, in common with the Tories of his time, felt for the English
militia force, found vent in the following vigorous passage, really
descriptive of them and their conduct though the scene is laid in
Rhodes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The country rings around with loud alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raw in fields the rude militia swarms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mouths without hands; maintained at vast expense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace a charge, in war a weak defense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stout once a month they march, a blustering band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever, but in times of need, at hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the morn when, issuing on the guard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn up in rank and file they stood prepared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of seeming arms to make a short essay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hasten to be drunk, the business of the day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a world where what is feeble in expression is so often supposed
to indicate peculiar delicacy; where what is vague is so often deemed
peculiarly poetical; and where what is involved and crabbed and
hard to comprehend is thought to denote peculiar profundity,&mdash;it is
a pleasure to turn to a writer with a rank settled by the consensus
of successive generations, who thought clearly and wrote forcibly,
who knew always what he had to say and then said it with directness
and power. There are greater poets than he; but so long as men
continue to delight in vividness of expression, in majesty of numbers,
in masculine strength and all-abounding vigor, so long will Dryden
continue to hold his present high place among English authors.</p>

<p>The writings of Dryden constitute of themselves a literature.
They treat of a vast variety of topics in many different departments
of intellectual activity. The completest edition of his works was first
published in 1808 under the editorship of Walter Scott. It fills twenty-one
volumes, the first of which however is devoted to a biography.
The notes to this edition are generally excellent; the text is very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4933" id="Page_4933">[Pg 4933]</a></span>
indifferent. A revised edition of it has been recently published under
the editorship of George Saintsbury. But easily accessible is
a single-volume edition of the poems alone, edited by W. D. Christie,
which furnishes a superior text, and is amply supplied with all
necessary annotations.</p>

<span class="i0">She feared no danger, for she knew no sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet had she oft been chased with horns and hounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Scythian shafts, and many winged wounds<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The immortal part assumed immortal state.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their native walk; whose vocal blood arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried for pardon on their perjured foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fate was fruitful, and the sanguine seed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So captive Israel multiplied in chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A numerous exile, and enjoyed her pains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grief and gladness mixed, their mother viewed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well then, the promised hour is come at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The present age of wit obscures the past:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong were our sires, and as they fought they writ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conquering with force of arms and dint of wit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theirs was the giant race before the flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, when Charles returned, our empire stood.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But both to Congreve justly shall submit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One matched in judgment, both o'ermatched in wit.<br /></span>

of infinite independence, whenever I have slept in the tent or in the
ruins of foreign lands?" The love of change and adventure has been the
spring of Du Camp's life, a life whose events are blended so
intimately with his literary achievement, that to know the one is to
know the other. This practical man of the world has an imaginative,
beauty-loving side to his nature, which craves stimulus from tropical
unfamiliar nature and exotic ways.</p>

<p>So, after the usual training of French boys in lyc&eacute;e and college,&mdash;"in
those hideous houses where they wearied our childhood," as he
says,&mdash;the just-emancipated youth of twenty-two left his home in Paris
for an eighteen-months' trip in the far East. The color and variety of
the experience whetted his love of travel, and very soon after his
return he began a serious study of photography in view of future
plans.</p>

<p>Then came the revolution of 1848, the overthrow of Louis Philippe; and
Du Camp had an opportunity to prove his courage and patriotism in the
ranks of the National Guard. In his 'Souvenirs de l'Ann&eacute;e
1848,' he tells the story with color and interest, and with the
forceful logic of an eye-witness.</p>

<p>His bravery and a serious wound won him the red ribbon of the
Legion of Honor, bestowed by General Cavaignac. This drew attention
to him, and led the minister of public instruction to intrust him
a few months later with a mission of exploration to Egypt, Nubia,
Palestine, and Asia Minor; a result of which trip was his first literary
success. Utilizing his photographic knowledge, he collected a great
many negatives for future development. Upon his return he published
a volume of descriptive sketches, 'Le Nil, Egypte, et Nubie,'
generously illustrated with printed reproductions of these pictures.
This first combination of photography and typography was popular,
and was speedily imitated, initiative of many illustrated books.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4952" id="Page_4952">[Pg 4952]</a></span>
Later, Du Camp's warlike and exploring instincts led him at his own
expense into Sicily with Garibaldi, where he collected matter and
photographs for 'Les Deux Siciles', another successful volume. In 1851
he associated with others to found the Revue de Paris, for which he
wrote regularly until its suspension in 1858. He has also written a
great deal for the Revue des Deux Mondes, in which for several years
he continued a series of historical studies upon the government of
Paris. The six volumes upon 'Paris: its Organs, its Functions, its
Life, during the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century,' form one of
his chief achievements. His personal knowledge on the subject, and his
access to valuable unpublished documents, give it authoritative value.</p>

<p>In 'Les Anc&ecirc;tres de la Commune,' and 'Les Convulsions de Paris,'
he has accomplished much more in the same line. The latter, a brilliant
circumstantial exposition of the Commune, a logical condemnation
of its folly and ignorance, brought him gratitude from the French
Academy, and aided his election to that body in 1880. For this extensive
work on contemporary politics, for his illustrated travels, and his
artistic and literary criticism, he is better known than for his two or
three novels and volumes of poetry.</p>

<p>Du Camp's may be characterized as a soldierly style, strong, direct,
and personal. He loves to retrace old scenes with the later visible
sequence of cause and effect. Always straightforward, sometimes
bluntly self-assertive, he is sometimes eloquent. Perhaps his great
charm is spontaneity.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="STREET" id="STREET"></a>A STREET SCENE DURING THE COMMUNE</h3>

<h4>From 'The Convulsions of Paris'</h4>

<p>There were strange episodes during this terrible evening. At half-past
eight, M. Rouville, a Protestant minister, was at home in a house he
owns on the Rue de Lille. He heard an alarm, the cry, "Everything is
burning! Escape!" Then he went down, saw the street in flames, and the
poor people weeping as they escaped. Just as he was returning to
rescue a few valuables, some federates rushed into the court, crying,
"Hurry! They are setting the place on fire!" He took some money and
the manuscript of the sermons he had preached. Mechanically he seized
his hat and cane. Then, throwing a last look around the apartment
where he had long lived, invoking the memory of the great Biblical
destructions familiar to him in Holy Writ,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4953" id="Page_4953">[Pg 4953]</a></span>
weak and trembling with emotion, he descended the staircase from his home.</p>

<p>There was indescribable tumult in the street, dominated by the cry of
women; a shrill wordless involuntary cry of terror, vibrating above
the uproar like a desperate appeal to which no supernatural power
replied. Pastor Rouville stopped. The house next his own was in
flames. They were setting fire to the one opposite. The houses between
the Rue de Beaune and the Rue du Bac, red from cellar to garret, were
vomiting flame from all the broken windows.</p>

<p>The pastor's family were not at Paris. He was alone with a faithful
maid, who did not leave him for a moment. This doubtless determined
his resolution, and gave him courage to brave all to save his house.
If he had felt his wife and daughter near, he would have thought only
of their safety, and would have hastened to get them away from the
place, where, he said, "One could die of horror."</p>

<p>Pastor Rouville is a small man, whose great activity keeps him young
and remarkably energetic. He belongs to the strong race of Southern
Protestants, which has resisted everything to guard its faith. I
should not be surprised if he has had some nimble C&eacute;vennole, companion
of Jean Cavalier, among his ancestors. Chaplain in the prisons of the
Seine, accustomed to sound doubtful spirits, to seek in vicious hearts
some intact fibres which could re-attach them to virtue; fervent in
faith, eloquent, with a high voice which could rise above the tumult,
knowing by experience that there is no obscurity so profound that
light cannot be made to penetrate it,&mdash;he had remained on duty at his
post during the Commune; for the prisoners had more need of spiritual
aid, now that the regular administration no longer watched over them.
He had been indignant at the incarceration of Catholic priests, and
had signed the fine protest demanding the liberty of the archbishop,
which the ministers had carried to the H&ocirc;tel de Ville.</p>

<p>Alone in the presence of the great disaster which threatened him, he
commended his spirit to God, remembering that the little stone of
David had killed the giant Philistine, and he decided to fight for his
home. He encamped energetically before the door, to forbid access; and
using the weapons bestowed upon him by Providence and study, he spoke.
The federates stopped before this man, whose simplicity rendered him
heroic. One may guess what he said to them:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4954" id="Page_4954">[Pg 4954]</a></span>
"Why strike the innocent and tender, as if they were execrable? Why be
enraged with a Protestant, a minister, whose religion, founded on the
dogma of free examination, is naturally allied to republican ideas?
The faith he teaches is that promulgated by Christ: Christ said to
Peter, 'Sheathe thy sword;' he said to men,'Love one another!' No, the
people of Paris, this people whose sufferings have been shared, whose
unfortunates have been succored during the siege; this people, so good
when not led astray by the wicked; this people will not burn the house
of a poor minister, whose whole life has been passed in the exercise
of charity."</p>

<p>The pastor must have been eloquent and have spoken with profound
conviction, for the federates who were listening to him began to weep,
then seized and embraced him. Meantime the tenants of the shops in his
house had lowered the iron curtains, which at least was an obstacle
against the first throwing of petroleum. This lasted an hour. The
federates, evidently softened and touched by the pastor's despair,
remained near him and had pity upon him. An old sergeant of the
National Guard stayed beside him, as if to bring him help in case of
need, and to maintain a little order among his subordinates. Some hope
revived in M. Rouville's heart, and he was saying to himself that
perhaps his house would be spared, when some young men, wearing the
braided caps of officers, arrived as if to inspect the fires. Seeing
one house intact, emerging like a little island from an ocean of
flames, they exclaimed. The pastor sprang forward and wanted to argue
with them. It was trouble wasted. One of these young scamps said to
him, "You are an old reactionist: you bore us with your talking. If
you don't like it, we will pin you to the wall." Then, turning toward
the federates and pointing to the houses on the Rue de Lille, he
cried, "All that belongs to the people. The people have the right to
burn every thing."</p>

<p>This had perhaps decided the fate of the pastor's house, when
the sergeant of federates interfered, and addressing the officer
said to him, "I have received orders to stop the fire just here."
"Show me your order," answered the officer. The sergeant replied,
"It is a verbal order." Then there was a lively quarrel
between the two men. The sergeant was firm. The officer insisted,
and according to the custom of the moment, threatened to
have the rebel shot.</p>

<p>The situation was becoming grave, when an incident resolved
it. A mounted officer galloped up and ordered all the federates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4955" id="Page_4955">[Pg 4955]</a></span>
to retreat, because they were about to be surrounded by the
troops from Versailles.</p>

<p>Nearly all the National Guards hurried away. The sergeant
who had remained near the pastor said, "Get away, scurry,
father! You will get yourself killed, and that will not save your
camp."</p>

<p>The other officers passed, commanded everything to be
burned, and when the sergeant resisted, compelled him to leave.
For half an hour the unhappy pastor remained alone, holding
back the incendiaries, passing from supplications to threats, and
gaining time by every possible artifice. The sergeant returned
with tearful eyes, and showed the dismayed pastor a written
order to burn the house, sent by his chiefs. Not yet discouraged,
the pastor roused the compassion of the old sergeant, and so
moved him that the rebel cried, "Ah, well! so much the worse!
I'll disobey. No, I won't let your house be burned. They'll
shoot me. It's all the same. I deserve to be." Then raising
his hand toward the sky, where the stars shone like sparks
through the veil of wind-driven smoke, he cried "O my father, I
believe in God! Fear nothing; I will stay here. They shan't
touch your house. I shall know how to keep off plunderers!"</p>

<p>O strange deceiving people; ready for all crimes, ready for all
good actions, according to the voice which speaks to thee and
the emotion which carries thee away! This sergeant was indeed
thy likeness, and one need not despair of thee, although thou
dishearten those who love thee best!</p>

<p>The brandy at the wine merchants'; the ether at the druggists';
the powder and shot forgotten in stations, or secreted in
cellars, burst with terrible explosions and scattered flaming coals.
The pastor looked at his house, still miraculously intact. He
gave it a last look, and departed sobbing. It was eleven o'clock.
For three hours in the midst of this furnace he had resisted the
incendiaries. His strength was exhausted. The faithful servant,
who went back again and again to rescue one thing more from
the burning, dragged him away. In the Rue des Saints-P&egrave;res
they plunged into darkness, all the deeper for the brazier of
sparkling lights behind them. They groped their way over the
barricades through a shower of bullets. More than once they
fell down. Finally, safe and sound despite the dangers braved,
they reached the Rue de Seine, near the Rue de Bucy, where
they found refuge in a lodging-house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4956" id="Page_4956">[Pg 4956]</a></span>
Next day Pastor Rouville ran towards the Rue de Lille. His
house was standing intact. The old sergeant had kept his word.
What became of this brave man, who at the risk of his life
saved the property of a man whose speech had touched him?
Perhaps he perished. Perhaps he received his due reward. Perhaps
he drags out a wretched life in some workshop of a penitentiary.
I know not his fate, nor even his name.</p>

<h2><a name="ALEXANDRE_DUMAS_SENIOR" id="ALEXANDRE_DUMAS_SENIOR"></a>ALEXANDRE DUMAS, SENIOR</h2>

<h4>(1803?-1870)</h4>

<h4>BY ANDREW LANG</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 89px;">
<img src="images/capn297.png" width="89" height="95" alt="N" title="N" />
</div><p class="dropcap">o author is less capable of being illustrated by extracts than
Alexandre Dumas. Writers like Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e or Mr. Robert Louis
Stevenson can be not inadequately represented by a short story or a
brief scene. Even from Scott's work we can detach 'Wandering Willie's
Tale,' or 'The Tapestried Chamber,' or the study of Effie Deans in
prison, or of Jeanie Deans before the Queen. But Dumas is invariably
diffuse; though, unlike other diffuse talkers and writers, he is
seldom tedious. He is long without <i>longueurs</i>. A single example will
explain this better than a page of disquisition. The present selector
had meant to extract Dumas's first meeting with Charles Nodier at the
theatre. In memory, that amusing scene appeared to occupy some six
pages. In fact, it covers nearly a hundred and thirty pages of the
Brussels edition of the 'Memoirs' of Dumas. One reads it with such
pleasure that looked back upon, it seems short, while it is infinitely
too long to be extracted. In dialogue Dumas is both excellent and
copious, so that he cannot well be abbreviated. He is the Porthos of
novelists, gigantic, yet (at his best) muscular and not overgrown. For
these reasons, extracts out of his romances do no justice to Dumas. To
read one of his novels, say 'The Three Musketeers,' even in a slovenly
translation, is to know more of him than a world of critics and
essayists can teach. It is also to forget the world, and to dwell in a
careless Paradise. Our object therefore is not to give an "essence of
Dumas," but to make readers peruse him in his own books, and to save
them trouble by indicating, among these books, the best.</p>

<p>It is notorious that Dumas was at the head of a "Company" like that
which Scott laughingly proposed to form "for writing and publishing
the class of books called Waverley Novels." In legal phrase, Dumas
"deviled" his work; he had assistants, "researchers," collaborators.
He would briefly sketch a plot, indicate the authorities to be
consulted, hand his notes to Maquet or Fiorentino, receive their
draught, and expand that into a romance. Work thus executed cannot be
equal to itself. Many books signed by Dumas may be neglected without
loss. Even to his best works, one or other of his assistants was apt
to assert a claim. The answer is convincing. Not one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4958" id="Page_4958">[Pg 4958]</a></span>
these ingenious men ever produced, by himself, anything that could be
mistaken for the work of the master. All his good things have the same
stamp and the same spirit, which we find nowhere else. Again, nobody
contests his authorship of his own 'Memoirs,' or of his book about his
dogs, birds, and other beasts&mdash;'The Story of My Pets.' Now, the merit
of these productions is, in kind, identical with many of the merits of
his best novels. There is the same good-humor, gayety, and fullness of
life. We may therefore read Dumas's central romances without much fear
of being grateful to the wrong person. Against the modern theory that
the Iliad and Odyssey are the work of many hands in many ages, we can
urge that these supposed "hands" never did anything nearly so good for
themselves; and the same argument applies in the case of Alexandre
Dumas.</p>

<p>A brief sketch of his life must now be given. "No man has had
so many of his possessions disputed as myself," says Dumas. Not
only his right to his novels, but his right to his name and to legitimate
birth, was contested. Here we shall follow his own account of
himself in his 'Memoirs,' which do not cover nearly the whole of his
life. Alexandre Dumas was born at Villers-Cotterets-sur-Aisne, on
July 24th, 1803(?). He lived to almost exactly the threescore and ten
years of the Psalmist. He saw the fall of Napoleon, the restoration
of the rightful king, the expulsion of the Legitimate monarch in
1830, the Orleans rule, its overthrow in 1848, the Republic, the
Empire, and the Terrible Year, 1870-1871. Then he died, in the
hour of the sorrow of his</p>

<p>Dumas's full name was noble: he was Alexandre Dumas-Davy de la
Pailleterie. His family estate, La Pailleterie, was made a marquisate
by Louis XIV. in 1707. About 1760 the grandfather of Dumas sold his
lands in France, and went to Hayti. There in 1762 was born his father,
son of Louise Cossette Dumas and of the Marquis de la Pailleterie. The
mother must have been a woman of color; Dumas talks of his father's
"mulatto hue," and he himself had undoubted traces of African blood.
Yet it appears that the grandparents were duly married. In 1772, his
wife having died, the old marquis returned to France. The Revolution
broke out, and the father of Alexandre Dumas fought in the armies of
the Republic. The cruel mob called him by way of mockery, "Monsieur
Humanity," because he endeavored to rescue the victims of their
ferocity. He was a man of great courage and enormous physical strength.
Napoleon, in honor of one of his feats of arms, called him in a dispatch
"The Horatius Cocles of the Republic." He was with Napoleon in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4959" id="Page_4959">[Pg 4959]</a></span>
Egypt, where a quarrel arose, as he suspected and opposed
the ambition of the future emperor. Though Dumas found a treasure in a
bey's house, he honorably presented it to his government. He died in
France, a poor man, in 1806.</p>

<p>Dumas was not at home when his father died. He was staying, a
child of four, with his cousin Marianne.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At midnight I was awakened, or rather my cousin and I were awakened,
by a great blow struck on the door of our room. By the light of a night
lamp I saw my cousin start up, much alarmed. No mortal could have
knocked at our chamber door, for the outer doors were locked. [He gives a
plan of the house.] I got out of bed to open the door. 'Where are you
going, Alexandre?' cried my cousin.</p>

<p>"'To let in papa, who is coming to say adieu.'</p>

<p>"The girl dragged me back to bed; I cried, 'Adieu, papa, adieu!' Something
like a sighing breath passed over my face.... My father had died
at the hour when we heard the knock!"</p></div>

<p>This anecdote may remind the reader of what occurred at Abbotsford
on the night when Mr. Bullock died in London. Dumas tells
another tale of the same kind ('Memoirs,' Vol. xi., page 255: Brussels,
1852). On the night of his mother's death he in vain sought a
similar experience. These things "come not by observation"; but
Dumas, like Scott, had a mind not untuned to such themes, though
not superstitious.</p>

<p>Young Dumas, like most men of literary genius, taught himself to
read. A Buffon with plates was the treasure of the child, already a
lover of animals. To know more about the beasts he learned to read
for his own pleasure. Of mythology he was as fond as Keats. His
intellectual life began (like the imaginative life of our race) in legends
of beasts and gods. For Dumas was born <i>un primitif</i>, as the French
say; his taste was the old immortal human taste for romance, for
tales of adventure, love, and war. This predilection is now of course
often scouted by critics who are over-civilized and under-educated.
Superior persons will never share the love of Dumas which was common
to Thackeray and Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson. From Buffon he
went on to the 'Letters to &Eacute;mil' (letters on mythology), and to the
'Arabian Nights.' An imaginative child, he knew the "pains of
sleep" as Coleridge did, and the terrors of vain imagination. Many
children whose manhood is not marked by genius are visionaries. A
visionary too was little Dumas, like Scott, Coleridge, and George
Sand in childhood. To the material world he ever showed a bold
face. "I have never known doubt or despair," he says; his faith in
God was always unshaken; the doctrine of immortality he regarded
rather with hope than absolute belief. Yet surely it is a corollary to
the main article of his creed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4960" id="Page_4960">[Pg 4960]</a></span>
At ten, Dumas went to a private school kept by an Abb&eacute; Gr&eacute;goire.
At the Restoration, a boy of twelve, he made and he adhered to an
important resolution. He chose to keep his grandmaternal name of
Dumas, like his father, and to drop the name and arms of De la
Pailleterie, with all the hopes of boons from the restored Royalists.
Dumas remained a man of the popular party, though he had certain
relations of friendship with the house of Orl&eacute;ans. But he entertained
no posthumous hatred of the old monarchy and the old times. His
kings are nearly as good, in his romances, as Sir Walter's own, and
his Henri III. and Henri IV. may be named with Scott's Gentle King
Jamie and Louis XI.</p>

<p>Madame Dumas, marquise as she was by marriage, kept a tobacconist's
shop; and in education, Dumas was mainly noted for his calligraphy.
Poaching was now the boy's favorite amusement; all through his life he
was very fond of sport. Napoleon returned from Elba; Dumas saw him
drive through Villers-Cotterets on his way to Waterloo. Soon
afterwards came in stragglers; the English, they said, had been
defeated at five o'clock on June 18th, but the Prussians arrived at
six o'clock and won the battle. What the English were doing between
five and six does not appear; it hardly seems that they quitted the
field. The theory of that British defeat at Waterloo was never
abandoned by Dumas. He saw Napoleon return through Villers-Cotterets.
"Wellington, B&uuml;low, Bl&uuml;cher, were but masks of men; really they were
spirits sent by the Most High to defeat Napoleon." It is a pious
opinion!</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen Dumas, like Scott, became a notary's clerk.
About this time he saw 'Hamlet' played, in the version of Ducis.
Corneille and Racine had always been disliked by this born romanticist.
'Hamlet' carried him off his feet. Soon afterwards he read
B&uuml;rger's 'Lenore,' the ballad which Scott translated at the very
beginning of his career as an author.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tramp! tramp! along the land they rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Splash! splash! along the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scourge is red, the spur drops blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flashing pebbles flee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This German ballad, says Scott, "struck him as the kind of thing
he could do himself." And Dumas found that the refrain</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hurrah, fant&ocirc;me, les morts vont vite,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was more to his taste than the French poetry of the eighteenth century.
He tried to translate 'Lenore.' Scott finished it in a night;
Dumas gave up in despair. But this, he says, was the beginning of
his authorship. He had not yet opened a volume of Scott or Cooper,
"ces deux grands romanciers." With a friend named Leuven he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4961" id="Page_4961">[Pg 4961]</a></span>
began to try to write plays (1820-1821). He now poached his way to
Paris, defraying his expenses with the game he shot on the road.
Shakespeare too was a poacher; let us excuse the eccentricities of
genius. He made Talma's acquaintance; he went to the play; he
resigned his clerkship: "Paris was my future." Thither he went; his
father's name served him with General Foy, and he obtained a little
post in the household of the Duc D'Orl&eacute;ans&mdash;a supernumerary secretaryship
at &pound;60 a year. At the play he met Charles Nodier, reading
the rarest of Elzevirs, and at intervals (like Charles Lamb) hissing
his own piece! This delightful scene, with its consequences, occupies
one hundred and thirty pages!</p>

<p>Dumas now made the acquaintance of Frederic Souli&eacute;, and became
a pillar of theatres. He began to read with a purpose: first he read
Scott; "The clouds lifted, and I beheld new horizons." Then he
turned to Cooper; then to Byron. One day he entered his office, crying
aloud, "Byron is dead!" "Who is Byron?" said one of his chiefs.
Here Dumas breaks off in his 'Memoirs' to give a life of Byron! He
fought his first duel in the snow, and won an easy, almost a bloodless
victory. For years he and Leuven wrote plays together,&mdash;plays
which were never accepted.</p>

<p>At last he, Rousseau (not Jean Jacques!), and Leuven composed a
piece together. Refused at one house, it was accepted at another:
'La Chasse et l'Amour' (The Chase and Love) was presented on
September 22d, 1823. It succeeded. A volume of three short stories
sold to the extent of four copies. Dumas saw that he must "make a
name" before he could make a livelihood. "I do not believe in neglected
talent and unappreciated genius," says he. Like Mr. Arthur
Pendennis, he wrote verses "up to" pictures. Thackeray did the
same. "Lady Blessington once sent him an album print of a boy and
girl fishing, with a request that he would make some verses for it.
'And,' he said, 'I liked the idea, and set about it at once. I was
two entire days at it,&mdash;was so occupied with it, so engrossed by it,
that I did not shave during the whole time.'" So says Mr. Locker-Lampson.</p>

<p>We cannot all be Dumas or Thackeray. But if any literary beginner
reads these lines, let him take Dumas's advice; let him disbelieve
in neglected genius, and do the work that comes in his way, as best
he can. Dumas had a little anonymous success in 1826, a vaudeville
at the Porte-Saint-Martin. At last he achieved a serious tragedy, or
melodrama, in verse, 'Christine.' He wrote to Nodier, reminding him
of their meeting at the play. The author of 'Trilby' introduced him
to Taylor; Taylor took him to the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais; 'Christine' was
read and accepted unanimously.</p>

<p>Dumas now struck the vein of his fortune. By chance he opened
a volume of Anquetil, and read an anecdote of the court of Henri III.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4962" id="Page_4962">[Pg 4962]</a></span>
This led him to study the history of Saint Megrin, in the Memoirs
of L'Estoile, where he met Quelus, and Maugiron, and Bussy d'Amboise,
with the stirring tale of his last fight against twelve men.
Out of these facts he made his play 'Henri III.,' and the same
studies inspired that trilogy of romances 'La Reine Margot' (Queen
Margot), 'La Dame de Monsoreau' (The Lady of Monsoreau), and
'Les Quarante-Cinq' (The Forty-Five). These are, with the trilogy
of the 'Mousquetaires,' his central works as a romancer, and he was
twenty-five when he began to deal with the romance of history. His
habit was to narrate his play or novel, to his friends, to invent as he
talked, and so to arrive at his general plan. The mere writing gave
him no trouble. We shall later show his method in the composition
of 'The Three Musketeers.'</p>

<p>'Christine' had been wrecked among the cross-currents of theatrical
life. 'Henri III.' was more fortunate. Dumas was indeed
obliged to choose between his little office and the stage; he abandoned
his secretaryship. In 1829 occurred this "duel between his
past and his future." Just before the first night of the drama,
Dumas's mother, whom he tenderly loved, was stricken down by
paralysis. He tended her, he watched over his piece, he almost
dragged the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans to the theatre. On that night he made
the acquaintance of Hugo and Alfred de Vigny. Dumas passed the
evening between the theatre and his mother's bedside. When the
curtain fell, he was "called on"; the audience stood up uncovered,
the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans and all!</p>

<p>Next morning Dumas, like Byron, "woke to find himself famous." He had
"made his name" in the only legitimate way,&mdash;by his work. Troubles
followed, difficulties with the Censorship, duels and rumors of duels,
and the whole romantic upheaval which accompanied the Revolution of
1830. Dumas was attached again to the Orl&eacute;ans household. He dabbled in
animal magnetism, which had been called mesmerism, and now is known as
hypnotism. The phenomena are the same; only the explanations vary.
About 1830 there was a mania for animal magnetism in Paris; Lady
Louisa Stuart recounted some of the marvels to Sir Walter Scott, who
treated the reports with disdain. When writing his romance 'Joseph
Balsamo' (a tale of the French Revolution), Dumas made studies of
animal magnetism, and was, or believed himself to be, an adept. The
orthodox party of modern hypnotists merely hold that by certain
physical means, a state of somnambulism can be produced in certain
people. Once in that state, the patients are subject, to "suggestion,"
and are obedient to the will of the hypnotizer. He for his part exerts
no "magnetic current," no novel unexplained force or fluid. Some recent
French and English experiments are not easily to be reconciled with this
hypothesis. Dumas himself believed that he exerted a magnetic force, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4963" id="Page_4963">[Pg 4963]</a></span>
without any "passes" or other mechanical means, could hypnotize persons who
did not know what he was about, and so were not influenced by "suggestion."
In a few cases he held that his patients became clairvoyant; one of
them made many political prophecies,&mdash;all unfulfilled. Another,
in trance, improved vastly as a singer; "her normal voice stopped at
<i>contre-si</i>. I bade her rise to <i>contre-re</i>, which she did; though
incapable of it when awake." So far, this justifies the plot of Mr. Du
Maurier's novel 'Trilby.' Dumas offers no theory; he states facts, as
he says, including "post-hypnotic suggestion."</p>

<p>These experiments were made by Dumas merely as part of his studies for
'Joseph Balsamo' (Cagliostro); his conclusion was that hypnotism is
not yet reduced to a scientific formula. In fiction it is already
overworked. Dumas got his 'Christine' acted at last. Then broke out
the Revolution of 1830. Dumas's description of his activity is "as
good as a novel," but too long and varied for condensation. It seems
better to give this extract about his life of poverty before his
mother died, before fame visited him. (I quote Miss Cheape's
translation of the passage included in her 'Stories of Beasts,'
published by Longmans, Green and Company.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He had, in later years, named a cat Mysouff II.</p>

<p>"If you won't think me impertinent, sir," said Madame Lamarque, "I should
so like to know what Mysouff means."</p>

<p>"Mysouff just means Mysouff, Madame Lamarque."</p>

<p>"It is a cat's name, then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, since Mysouff the First was so-called. It is true, Madame
Lamarque, you never knew Mysouff." And I became so thoughtful that
Madame Lamarque was kind enough to withdraw quietly, without asking
any questions about Mysouff the First.</p>

<p>That name had taken me back to fifteen years ago, when my mother was
still living. I had then the great happiness of having a mother to
scold me sometimes. At the time I speak of, I held a situation in the
service of the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, with a salary of 1500 francs. My work
occupied me from ten in the morning until five in the afternoon. We
had a cat in those days, whose name was Mysouff. This cat had missed
his vocation; he ought to have been a dog. Every morning I started for
my office at half-past nine, and came back every evening at half-past
five. Every morning Mysouff followed me to the corner of a particular
street, and every evening I found him in the same street, at the same
corner, waiting for me. Now the curious thing was that on the days
when I had found some amusement elsewhere, and was not coming home to
dinner, it was of no use to open the door for Mysouff to go and meet
me. Mysouff, in the attitude of the serpent with its tail in its
mouth, refused to stir from his cushion. On the other hand, on the
days I did come, Mysouff would scratch at the door until some one
opened it for him. My mother was very fond of Mysouff; she used to
call him her barometer.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4964" id="Page_4964">[Pg 4964]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mysouff marks my good and my bad weather," my dear mother would
say: "the days you come in are my days of sunshine; my rainy days are
when you stay away."</p>

<p>When I came home I used to see Mysouff at the street corner, sitting
quite still and gazing into the distance. As soon as he caught sight
of me, he began to move his tail; then as I drew nearer, he rose and
walked backward and forward across the pavement with his back arched
and his tail in the air. When I reached him, he jumped up upon me as a
dog would have done, and bounded and played round me as I walked
towards the house; but when I was close to it he dashed in at full
speed. Two seconds after, I used to see my mother at the door.</p>

<p>Never again in this world, but perhaps in the next, I shall see her
standing waiting for me at the door.</p>

<p>That is what I was thinking of, dear readers, when the name of Mysouff
brought back all these recollections; so you understand why I did not
answer Madame Lamarque's question.</p></div>

<p>The life of Dumas after 1830 need not be followed step by step;
indeed, for lack of memoirs, to follow it is by no means easy.</p>

<p>Dumas, by dint of successful plays, and later of successful novels,
earned large sums of money&mdash;&pound;40,000 in one year, it is said. He
traveled far and wide, and compiled books of travel. In the forties,
before the Revolution of 1848, he built a kind of Abbotsford of his
own, named "Monte Cristo," near St. Germains, and joyously ruined
himself. "Monte Cristo," like Abbotsford, has been described as a
palace. Now, Abbotsford is so far from being a palace that Mr.
Hope Scott, when his wife, Scott's granddaughter, inherited the place,
was obliged to build an additional wing.</p>

<p>At Monte Cristo Dumas kept but one man-servant, Michel (his "Tom
Purdie"), who was groom, keeper, porter, gardener, and everything. Nor
did Dumas ruin himself by paying exorbitant prices for poor lands, as
Scott did. His collection of books and curios was no rival for that of
Abbotsford. But like Scott, he gave away money to right and left, and
he kept open house. He was eaten up by parasites,&mdash;beggars, poor
greedy hangers-on of letters, secretaries, above all by tribes of
musical people. On every side money flowed from him; hard as he
worked, largely as he earned, he spent more. His very dog brought in
thirteen other dogs to bed and board. He kept monkeys, cats, eagles, a
vulture, a perfect menagerie. His own account of these guests may be
read in "My Pets"; perhaps the most humorous, good-humored, and
amusing of all his works.</p>

<p>The Revolution of 1848 impoverished him and drove him from
Monte Cristo; not out of debt to his neighbors. Dumas was a cheerful
giver, but did not love to "fritter away his money in paying
bills." He started newspapers, such as The Musketeer, and rather
lost than gained by a careless editorship. A successful play would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4965" id="Page_4965">[Pg 4965]</a></span>
enrich him, and he would throw away his gains. He went with
Garibaldi on his expedition against the King of Naples, and was
received with ingratitude by the Neapolitans.</p>

<p>A friend of Daniel Dunglas Home, the "medium," he accompanied
him to Russia, where Home married a lady of a noble and wealthy
family. Returned to France, Dumas found his popularity waning.
His plays often failed; he had outlived his success and his generation;
he had saved nothing; he had to turn in need to his son
Alexandre, the famous dramatist. Finally he died, doubting the
security of his own fame, in the year of the sorrows of France.</p>

<p>Dumas is described by Michelet as "a force of nature." Never
was there in modern literature a force more puissant, more capricious,
or more genial. His quantity of mind was out of all proportion
to its quality. He could learn everything with ease; he was a
skilled cook, a fencer; he knew almost as if by intuition the technique
and terminology of all arts and crafts. Ignorant of Greek, he
criticized and appreciated Homer with an unmatched zest and appreciation.
Into the dry bones of history he breathed life, mere names
becoming full-blooded fellow-creatures under his spell. His inspiration
was derived from Scott, a man far more learned than he, but
scarcely better gifted with creative energy. Like Scott he is long,
perhaps prolix; like him he is indifferent to niceties of style, does
not linger over the choice of words, but serves himself with the first
that comes to hand. Scott's wide science of human nature is not his;
but his heroes, often rather ruffianly, are seldom mere exemplary
young men of no particular mark. More brilliantly and rapidly than
Scott, he indicates action in dialogue. He does not aim at the construction
of rounded plots; his novels are chronicles which need never
stop while his heroes are alive. His plan is to take a canvas of fact,
in memoir or history, and to embroider his fantasies on that. Occasionally
the canvas (as Mr. Saintsbury says) shows through, and we
have blocks of actual history. His 'Joan of Arc' begins as a romance,
and ends with a comparatively plain statement of facts too
great for any art but Shakespeare's. But as a rule it is not historical
facts, it is the fictitious adventures of characters living in an
historical atmosphere, that entertain us in Dumas.</p>

<p>The minute inquirer may now compare the sixteenth-century 'Memoirs of
Monsieur D'Artagnan' (fictitious memoirs, no doubt) with the use made
of them by Dumas in 'The Three Musketeers' and 'Twenty Years After.'
The 'Memoirs' (reprinted by the Librairie Illustr&eacute;e, Paris) gave Dumas
his opening scenes; gave him young D'Artagnan, Porthos, Athos, Aramis, Rosnay,
De Treville, Milady, the whole complicated intrigue of Milady, D'Artagnan,
and De Vardes. They gave him several incidents, duels, and "local color." By
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4966" id="Page_4966">[Pg 4966]</a></span>
making Milady the wife of Athos, Dumas knotted his plot;
he added the journey to England, after the Queen's diamonds;
from a subordinate character he borrowed the clerical character
of Aramis; a mere hint in the 'Memoirs' suggested the Bastion
Saint-Gervais. The discrimination of character, the dialogue, and many
adventures, are Dumas's own; he was aided by Maquet in the actual
writing. In a similar way, Brant&ocirc;me and L'Estoile, in their 'Memoirs,'
supply the canvas of the tales of the Valois cycle.</p>

<p>The beginner in Dumas will assuredly find the following his best
works. For the Valois period, 'The Horoscope' (a good deal neglected),
'Queen Margot,' 'The Lady of Monsoreau,' 'The Forty-Five.'
'Isabeau of Bavi&egrave;re,' an early novel, deals with the anarchy and
misery before the coming of Jeanne d'Arc. For Henri II., 'The Two
Dianas' is indicated. For the times of Richelieu, Mazarin, Louis
XIV., we have 'The Three Musketeers,' 'Twenty Years After,' and
'The Viscount of Bragelonne.' These deal with the youth, middle
age, old age, and death of D'Artagnan, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis.
The Revolutionary novels, 'Joseph Balsamo,' 'The Queen's Necklace,'
and others, are much less excellent. The Regency is not ill done in
'The Regent's Daughter'; and 'The Chevalier of Harmenthal,' with
'Olympe of Cleves,' has many admirers. Quite apart from these is
the immense modern fantasy of 'The Count of Monte Cristo'; the
opening part alone is worthy of the master. 'The Black Tulip,' so
warmly praised by Thackeray, is an innocent little romance of the
days of Dutch William. <i>Les jeunes filles</i> may read 'The Black Tulip':
indeed, Dumas does not sacrifice at all to "the Goddess of Lubricity,"
even when he describes very lax moralities.</p>

<p>With a knowledge of these books, and of 'My Pets' and the
'Memoirs,' any student will find himself at home in Dumas, and can
make wider ranges in that great wilderness of fancy. Some autobiographical
details will be found in the novel called 'Ange Pithou.'
'Isaac Laquedem' was meant to be a romance of the Wandering
Jew; only two volumes are published. Philosophy a reader will not
find, nor delicate analysis, nor "chiseled style"; but he will be in
touch with a great sunny life, rejoicing in all the accidents of existence.</p>

<h3><a name="CURE" id="CURE"></a>THE CURE FOR DORMICE THAT EAT PEACHES</h3>

<h4>From 'The Count of Monte Cristo'</h4>

<p>Not on the same night he had intended, but the next morning, the Count
of Monte Cristo went out on the road to Orl&eacute;ans. Leaving the village
of Linas, without stopping at the telegraph, which at the moment the
count passed threw out its long bony arms, he reached the tower of
Montlh&eacute;ry, situated, as every one knows, upon the highest point of the
plain of that name. At the foot of the hill the count dismounted, and
began to ascend the mountain by a little winding path about eighteen
inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a
hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers.</p>

<p>Monte Cristo looked for the door of the inclosure, and was
not long in finding it. It was a little wooden gate, working on
willow hinges, and fastened with a nail and string. The count
soon understood its mechanism, and the door opened. He then
found himself in a little marvelously well-kept garden, about
twenty feet long by twelve wide, bounded on one side by part
of the hedge, in which was formed the ingenious machine we
have named a door; and on the other by the old tower, covered
with ivy and studded with wild flowers. Monte Cristo stopped,
after having closed the door and fastened the string to the nail,
and cast a look around.</p>

<p>"The man at the telegraph," said he, "must either keep a gardener
or devote himself passionately to horticulture." Suddenly
he struck himself against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow
filled with leaves; the something rose, uttered an exclamation
of astonishment, and Monte Cristo found himself facing a
man about fifty years old, who was plucking strawberries, which
he was placing upon vine-leaves. He had twelve leaves and
about as many strawberries, which, on rising suddenly, he let
fall from his hand. "You are gathering your crop, sir?" said
Monte Cristo, smiling.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," replied the man, raising his hand to his
cap; "I am not up there, I know, but I have only just come
down."</p>

<p>"Do not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend,"
said the count; "gather your strawberries, if indeed there are
any left."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4968" id="Page_4968">[Pg 4968]</a></span>
"I have ten left," said the man, "for here are eleven, and I
had twenty-one, five more than last year. But I am not surprised;
the spring has been warm this year, and strawberries require
heat, sir. This is the reason that, instead of the sixteen I
had last year, I have this year, you see, eleven already plucked&mdash;twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.
Ah, I miss three! they were here last night, sir&mdash;I am sure
they were here&mdash;I counted them. It must be the son of Mother
Simon who has stolen them; I saw him strolling about here this
morning. Ah! the young rascal! stealing in a garden; he does
not know where that may lead him to."</p>

<p>"Certainly, it is wrong," said Monte Cristo, "but you should
take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the gardener, "but that does not make it
the less unpleasant. But, sir, once more I beg pardon; perhaps
you are an official that I am detaining here?" And he glanced
timidly at the count's blue coat.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my friend," said the count, with that smile
which at his will became so terrible or benevolent, and which
this time beamed only with the latter expression; "I am not an
inspector, but a traveler, conducted here by curiosity he half repents
of, since he causes you to lose your time."</p>

<p>"Ah! my time is not valuable," replied the man, with a melancholy
smile. "Still, it belongs to the government, and I ought not to
waste it; but having received the signal that I might rest for an
hour" (here he glanced at a sun-dial, for there was everything in
the inclosure of Montlh&eacute;ry, even a sun-dial), "and having ten
minutes before me, and my strawberries being ripe, when a day
longer&mdash;by-the-by, sir, do you think dormice eat them?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should think not," replied Monte Cristo: "dormice
are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the
Romans did."</p>

<p>"What! did the Romans eat them?" said the gardener; "eat
dormice?"</p>

<p>"I have read so," said the count.</p>

<p>"Really! They can't be nice, though they do say 'as fat as
a dormouse.' It is not a wonder they are fat, sleeping all day,
and only waking to eat all night. Listen: last year I had four
apricots&mdash;they stole one; I had one nectarine, only one&mdash;well,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4969" id="Page_4969">[Pg 4969]</a></span>
sir, they ate half of it on the wall; a splendid nectarine&mdash;I
never ate a better."</p>

<p>"You ate it?"</p>

<p>"That is to say, the half that was left&mdash;you understand; it was
exquisite, sir. Ah, those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels;
like Mother Simon's son, who has not chosen the worst strawberries.
But this year," continued the horticulturist, "I'll take care it shall
not happen, even if I should be forced to sit up the whole night to
watch when the strawberries are ripe." Monte Cristo had seen enough.
Every man has a devouring passion in his heart, as every fruit has its
worm; that of the man at the telegraph was horticulture. He began
gathering the vine-leaves which screened the sun from the grapes, and
won the heart of the gardener. "Did you come here, sir, to see the
telegraph?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, if not contrary to the rules."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said the gardener; "there are no orders against
doing so, providing there is nothing dangerous, and that no one
knows what we are saying."</p>

<p>"I have been told," said the count, "that you do not always
yourselves understand the signals you repeat."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir; and that is what I like best," said the man,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Why do you like that best?"</p>

<p>"Because then I have no responsibility. I am a machine
then, and nothing else; and so long as I work, nothing more is
required of me."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said Monte Cristo to himself, "that I can
have met with a man that has no ambition? That would spoil
my plans."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, "the ten
minutes are nearly expired; I must return to my post. Will you
go up with me?"</p>

<p>"I follow you." Monte Cristo entered the tower, which was divided into
three stages. The lowest contained gardening implements, such as
spades, rakes, watering-pots, hung against the wall; this was all the
furniture. The second was the usual dwelling or rather sleeping-place
of the man; it contained a few poor articles of household furniture, a
bed, a table, two chairs, a stone pitcher, and some dry herbs hung up
to the ceiling, which the count recognized as sweet-peas, and of which the good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4970" id="Page_4970">[Pg 4970]</a></span>
man was preserving the seeds, having labeled them with as much care as if he had been a botanist.</p>

<p>"Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing,
sir?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>"The study does not take long; it was acting as a supernumerary
that was so tedious."</p>

<p>"And what is the pay?"</p>

<p>"A thousand francs, sir."</p>

<p>"It is nothing."</p>

<p>"No; but then we are lodged, as you perceive."</p>

<p>Monte Cristo looked at the room. They passed on to the
third stage; it was the room of the telegraph. Monte Cristo
looked in turns at the two iron handles by which the machine
was worked. "It is very interesting," he said; "but it must be
very tedious for a lifetime."</p>

<p>"Yes. At first my neck was cramped with looking at it, but
at the end of a year I became used to it; and then we have our
hours of recreation, and our holidays when we have a fog."</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Those are indeed holidays to me; I go into the garden, I
plant, prune, trim, and kill the insects all day long."</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Ten years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen."</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fifty-five years old."</p>

<p>"How long must you serve to claim the pension?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, twenty-five years."</p>

<p>"And how much is the pension?"</p>

<p>"A hundred crowns."</p>

<p>"Poor humanity!" murmured Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>"What did you say, sir?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"I was saying it was very interesting."</p>

<p>"What was?"</p>

<p>"All you were showing me. And you really understand none
of these signals?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"And have you never tried to understand them?"</p>

<p>"Never. Why should I?"</p>

<p>"But still there are some signals only addressed to you."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And do you understand them?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4971" id="Page_4971">[Pg 4971]</a></span>
"They are always the same."</p>

<p>"And they mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Nothing new</i>; <i>You have an hour</i>; or <i>To-morrow</i>."</p>

<p>"This is simple enough," said the count; "but look! is not
your correspondent putting himself in motion?"</p>

<p>"Ah yes; thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"And what is it saying&mdash;anything you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it asks if I am ready."</p>

<p>"And you reply?"</p>

<p>"By the same sign, which at the same time tells my right-hand
correspondent that I am ready, while it gives notice to my
left-hand correspondent to prepare in his turn."</p>

<p>"It is very ingenious," said the count.</p>

<p>"You will see," said the man, proudly; "in five minutes he
will speak."</p>

<p>"I have then five minutes," said Monte Cristo to himself;
"it is more time than I require. My dear sir, will you allow me
to ask you a question?"</p>

<p>"What is it, sir?"</p>

<p>"You are fond of gardening?"</p>

<p>"Passionately."</p>

<p>"And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace
of twenty feet, an inclosure of two acres?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I should make a terrestrial paradise of it."</p>

<p>"You live badly on your thousand francs?"</p>

<p>"Badly enough; but yet I do live."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you have only a small garden."</p>

<p>"True, the garden is not large."</p>

<p>"And then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat
everything."</p>

<p>"Ah! they are my scourges."</p>

<p>"Tell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head
while your right-hand correspondent was telegraphing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should not see him."</p>

<p>"Then what would happen?"</p>

<p>"I could not repeat the signals."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Not having repeated them, through negligence, I should be
fined."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"A hundred francs."</p>

<p>"The tenth of your income&mdash;that would be fine work."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4972" id="Page_4972">[Pg 4972]</a></span>
"Ah!" said the man.</p>

<p>"Has it ever happened to you?" said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>"Once, sir, when I was grafting a rose-tree."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute
another?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that is another case; I should be turned off, and lose
my pension."</p>

<p>"Three hundred francs."</p>

<p>"A hundred crowns; yes, sir; so you see that I am not likely
to do any of these things."</p>

<p>"Not even for fifteen years' wages? Come, it is worth thinking
about?"</p>

<p>"For fifteen thousand francs!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sir, you alarm me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Sir, you are tempting me?"</p>

<p>"Just so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Sir, let me see my right-hand correspondent!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, do not look at him, but on this."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What! do you not know these little papers?"</p>

<p>"Bank-notes!"</p>

<p>"Exactly; there are fifteen of them."</p>

<p>"And whose are they?"</p>

<p>"Yours, if you like."</p>

<p>"Mine!" exclaimed the man, half suffocated.</p>

<p>"Yes; yours&mdash;your own property."</p>

<p>"Sir, my right-hand correspondent is signaling."</p>

<p>"Let him."</p>

<p>"Sir, you have distracted me; I shall be fined."</p>

<p>"That will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your
interest to take my bank-notes."</p>

<p>"Sir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is
impatient."</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;take these;" and the count placed the packet
in the hands of the man. "Now, this is not all," he said; "you
cannot live upon your fifteen thousand francs."</p>

<p>"I shall still have my place."</p>

<p>"No! you will lose it, for you are going to alter the sign of
your correspondent."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, what are you proposing?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4973" id="Page_4973">[Pg 4973]</a></span>
"A jest!"</p>

<p>"Sir, unless you force me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think I can effectually force you;" and Monte Cristo drew
another packet from his pocket. "Here are ten thousand more
francs," he said; "with the fifteen thousand already in your
pocket, they will make twenty-five thousand. With five thousand
you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land;
the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand
francs a year."</p>

<p>"A garden with two acres of land!"</p>

<p>"And a thousand francs a year."</p>

<p>"Oh heavens!"</p>

<p>"Come, take them!" and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes
into his hand.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very difficult."</p>

<p>"But what is it?"</p>

<p>"To repeat these signs;" Monte Cristo took a paper from his
pocket, upon which were drawn three signs, with numbers to
indicate the order in which they were to be worked.</p>

<p>"There, you see it will not take long."</p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest."
The mark was hit: red with fever, while the large drops fell
from his brow, the man executed, one after the other, the three
signs given by the count; notwithstanding the frightful contortions
of the right-hand correspondent, who, not understanding the
change, began to think the gardener had become mad. As to
the left-hand one, he conscientiously repeated the same signals,
which were definitively carried to the Minister of the Interior.
"Now you are rich," said Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man, "but at what a price!"</p>

<p>"Listen, friend," said Monte Cristo. "I do not wish to cause
you any remorse; believe me, then, when I swear to you that
you have wronged no man, but on the contrary have benefited
mankind." The man looked at the bank-notes, felt them, counted
them; he turned pale, then red; then rushed into his room to
drink a glass of water, but he had no time to reach the water-jug,
and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs. Five minutes
after the new telegram reached the minister, Debray had the
horses put to his carriage, and drove to Danglars's.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4974" id="Page_4974">[Pg 4974]</a></span>
"Has your husband any Spanish bonds?" he asked of the baroness.</p>

<p>"I think so, indeed! He has six millions' worth."</p>

<p>"He must sell them at whatever price."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges, and has returned
to Spain."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"&mdash;Debray shrugged his shoulders. "The idea of asking
how I hear the news!" he said. The baroness did not wait for a
repetition; she ran to her husband, who immediately hastened to his
agent and ordered him to sell at any price. When it was seen that
Danglars sold, the Spanish funds fell directly. Danglars lost five
hundred thousand francs; but he rid himself of all his Spanish shares.
The same evening the following was read in Le Messager:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Telegraphic dispatch. The King, Don Carlos, has escaped the
vigilance exercised over him at Bourges, and has returned to Spain
by the Catalonian frontier. Barcelona has risen in his favor."</p></div>

<p>All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars,
who had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only
lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow. Those who had kept
their shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as
ruined, and passed a very bad night. Next morning Le Moniteur
contained the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was without any foundation that Le Messager yesterday announced
the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The
King (Don Carlos) has not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the
enjoyment of profound peace. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted
owing to the fog, was the cause of this error."</p></div>

<p>The funds rose one per cent, higher than before they had
fallen. This, reckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining,
made the difference of a million to Danglars. "Good!" said
Monte Cristo to Morrel, who was at his house when the news
arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which Danglars had
been the victim. "I have just made a discovery for twenty-five
thousand francs, for which I would have paid a hundred thousand."</p>

<p>"What have you discovered?" asked Morrel.</p>

<p>"I have just discovered the method of ridding a gardener of
the dormice that eat his peaches."</p>

<h3><a name="SHOULDER" id="SHOULDER"></a>THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BELT OF PORTHOS, AND THE
HANDKERCHIEF OF ARAMIS</h3>

<h4>From 'The Three Musketeers'</h4>

<p>Furious with rage, D'Artagnan crossed the ante-room in three
strides, and began to descend the stairs four steps at a
time, without looking where he was going; when suddenly
he was brought up short by knocking violently against the
shoulder of a musketeer who was leaving the apartments of
M. De Treville. The young man staggered backwards from the
shock, uttering a cry, or rather a yell.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said D'Artagnan, trying to pass him, "but I
am in a great hurry."</p>

<p>He had hardly placed his foot on the next step, when he was
stopped by the grasp of an iron wrist on his sash.</p>

<p>"You are in a great hurry!" cried the musketeer, whose face
was the color of a shroud; "and you think that is enough apology
for nearly knocking me down? Not so fast, my young man. I
suppose you imagine that because you heard M. De Treville
speaking to us rather brusquely to-day, that everybody may treat
us in the same way? But you are mistaken, and it is as well
you should learn that you are not M. De Treville."</p>

<p>"Upon my honor," replied D'Artagnan, recognizing Athos, who was
returning to his room after having his wound dressed, "upon my honor,
it was an accident, and therefore I begged your pardon. I should have
thought that was all that was necessary. I repeat that I am in a very
great hurry, and I should be much obliged if you would let me go my
way."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Athos, loosening his hold, "you are sadly lacking in
courtesy, and one sees that you must have had a rustic upbringing."</p>

<p>D'Artagnan was by this time half-way down another flight; but on
hearing Athos's remark he stopped short.</p>

<p>"My faith, monsieur!" exclaimed he, "however rustic I may be, I shall
not come to you to teach me manners."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," replied Athos.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I was only not in such haste," cried D'Artagnan; "if only I
was not pursuing somebody&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you will find me without running after me. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4976" id="Page_4976">[Pg 4976]</a></span>
"And where, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Near Carmes-Deschaux."</p>

<p>"At what hour?"</p>

<p>"Twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"Very good. At twelve I will be there."</p>

<p>"And don't be late, for at a quarter past twelve I will cut off your
ears for you."</p>

<p>"All right," called out D'Artagnan, dashing on down-stairs after his
man; "you may expect me at ten minutes before the hour."</p>

<p>But he was not to escape so easily. At the street door stood Porthos,
talking to a sentry, and between the two men there was barely space
for a man to pass. D'Artagnan took it for granted that he could get
through, and darted on, swift as an arrow, but he had not reckoned on
the gale that was blowing. As he passed, a sudden gust wrapped
Porthos's mantle tight round him; and though the owner of the garment
could easily have freed him had he so chosen, for reasons of his own
he preferred to draw the folds still closer.</p>

<p>D'Artagnan, hearing the volley of oaths let fall by the musketeers,
feared he might have damaged the splendor of the belt, and struggled
to unwind himself; but when he at length freed his head, he found that
like most things in this world the belt had two sides, and while the
front bristled with gold, the back was mere leather; which explains
why Porthos always had a cold and could not part from his mantle.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" cried Porthos, struggling in his turn, "have you gone
mad, that you tumble over people like this?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," answered D'Artagnan, "but I am in a great hurry. I am
pursuing some one, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I suppose that on such occasions you leave your eyes behind you?"
asked Porthos.</p>

<p>"No," replied D'Artagnan, rather nettled; "and thanks to my eyes, I
often see things that other people don't."</p>

<p>Possibly Porthos might have understood this allusion, but in any case
he did not attempt to control his anger, and said sharply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur, we shall have to give you a lesson if you take to tumbling
against the musketeers like this!"</p>

<p>"A lesson, monsieur!" replied D'Artagnan; "that is rather a severe
expression."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4977" id="Page_4977">[Pg 4977]</a></span>
"It is the expression of a man who is always accustomed to look his
enemies in the face."</p>

<p>"Oh, if that is all, there is no fear of <i>your</i> turning your back on
anybody," and enchanted at his own wit, the young man walked away in
fits of laughter.</p>

<p>Porthos foamed with rage, and rushed after D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"By-and-by, by-and-by," cried the latter; "when you have not got your
mantle on."</p>

<p>"At one o'clock then, behind the Luxembourg."</p>

<p>"All right; at one o'clock," replied D'Artagnan as he vanished around
the corner.</p>

<p>But he could see no one either in the street he had passed through, or
in the one his eager gaze was searching; however slowly the stranger
might have walked, he had gone his way, or perhaps into some house.
D'Artagnan inquired of everybody he met, but could find nothing at all
about him. This chase however did him good in one way; for in
proportion as the sweat started out on his forehead, his heart began
to cool.</p>

<p>He began to think over the many unlucky things which had happened. It
was scarcely eleven in the morning, and yet this morning had already
brought him into disgrace with M. Treville, who must think the way
D'Artagnan had left him was rather boorish.</p>

<p>Moreover, he had gotten himself into two fierce duels with two men,
each able to kill three D'Artagnans; in a word, with two
musketeers,&mdash;beings he set so high that he placed them above all other
men.</p>

<p>It was a sad lookout. To be sure, as the youth was certain to be
killed by Athos, he was not much disturbed about Porthos. As hope is
the last thing to die in a man's heart, however, he ended by hoping
that he might come out alive from both duels, even if dreadfully
injured; and on that supposition he scored himself in this way for his
conduct:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a rattle-headed dunce I am! That brave and unfortunate Athos was
wounded right on that shoulder I ran against head-foremost, like a
ram. The only thing that surprises me is that he didn't strike me dead
on the spot; he had provocation enough, for I must have hurt him
savagely. As to Porthos&mdash;oh! as to Porthos&mdash;that's a funny affair!"</p>

<p>And the youth began to laugh aloud in spite of himself; looking round
carefully, however, to see if his laughing alone in public without
apparent cause aroused any suspicion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4978" id="Page_4978">[Pg 4978]</a></span>
"As to Porthos, it is funny enough, to be sure, but I am a crazy
blockhead all the same. Are people to be run into without warning? No!
And have I any right to peep under their cloaks to see what they
haven't got? He would have forgiven me, I am sure, if I had said
nothing to him about that cursed cloak,&mdash;with a double meaning, it is
true, but too broad a joke in one of them! Ah! cursed Gascon that I
am, I believe I should crack a joke if I was being roasted over a slow
fire. Friend D'Artagnan," he went on, speaking to himself with the
gentleness he thought fair, "if you get away, which there is not much
chance of, I would advise you to practice entire politeness for the
future. You must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it. To
be obliging and civil does not necessarily make a man a coward. Look
at Aramis, now: mildness and grace embodied; and did anybody ever
dream of calling Aramis a coward? No indeed, and from this instant I
will try to model myself after him. And luckily, here he is."</p>

<p>D'Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had come within a few steps of
the Aiguillon House, and in front of it saw Aramis chatting gayly with
three of the King's Guards. Aramis also saw D'Artagnan; but not having
forgotten that it was in his presence M. de Treville had got so angry
in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke was not at all
pleasant, he pretended not to see him. D'Artagnan, on the other hand,
full of his plans of conciliation and politeness, approached the young
man with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile. Aramis
bowed slightly but did not smile. Moreover, all four immediately broke
off their conversation.</p>

<p>D'Artagnan was not so dull as not to see he was not wanted; but he was
not yet used enough to social customs to know how to extricate himself
dexterously from his false position, which his generally is who
accosts people he is little acquainted with, and mingles in a
conversation which does not concern him. He was mentally casting about
for the least awkward manner of retreat, when he noticed that Aramis
had let his handkerchief fall, and (doubtless by mistake) put his foot
on it. This seemed a favorable chance to repair his mistake of
intrusion: he stooped down, and with the most gracious air he could
assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot in spite of the
efforts made to detain it, and holding it out to Aramis, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe, sir, this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4979" id="Page_4979">[Pg 4979]</a></span>
The handkerchief was in truth richly embroidered, and had a cornet and
a coat of arms at one corner. Aramis blushed excessively, and snatched
rather than took the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" exclaimed one of the guards, "will you go on saying now,
most discreet Aramis, that you are not on good terms with Madame de
Bois-Tracy, when that gracious lady does you the favor of lending you
her handkerchief!"</p>

<p>Aramis darted at D'Artagnan one of those looks which tell a man that
he has made a mortal enemy; then assuming his mild air he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, gentlemen: this handkerchief is not mine, and I
cannot understand why this gentleman has taken it into his head to
offer it to me rather than to one of you. And as a proof of what I
say, here is mine in my pocket."</p>

<p>So saying, he pulled out his handkerchief, which was also not only a
very dainty one, and of fine linen (though linen was then costly), but
was embroidered and without arms, bearing only a single cipher, the
owner's.</p>

<p>This time D'Artagnan saw his mistake; but Aramis's friends were by no
means convinced, and one of them, addressing the young musketeer with
pretended gravity, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If things were as you make out, I should feel obliged, my dear
Aramis, to reclaim it myself; for as you very well know, Bois-Tracy is
an intimate friend of mine, and I cannot allow one of his wife's
belongings to be exhibited as a trophy."</p>

<p>"You make the demand clumsily," replied Aramis; "and while I
acknowledge the justice of your reclamation, I refuse it on account of
the form."</p>

<p>"The fact is," D'Artagnan put in hesitatingly, "I did not actually see
the handkerchief fall from M. Aramis's pocket. He had his foot on it,
that's all, and I thought it was his."</p>

<p>"And you were deceived, my dear sir," replied Aramis coldly, very
little obliged for the explanation; then turning to the guard who had
professed himself Bois-Tracy's friend&mdash;"Besides," he went on, "I have
reflected, my dear intimate friend of Bois-Tracy, that I am not less
devotedly his friend than you can possibly be, so that this
handkerchief is quite as likely to have fallen from your pocket as
from mine!"</p>

<p>"On my honor, no!"</p>

<p>"You are about to swear on your honor, and I on my word; and
then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4980" id="Page_4980">[Pg 4980]</a></span>
Now here, Montaran, we will do better than that: let each take a half."</p>

<p>"Perfectly fair," cried the other two guardsmen; "the judgment of
Solomon! Aramis, you are certainly full of wisdom!"</p>

<p>They burst into a loud laugh, and as may be supposed, the incident
bore no other fruit. In a minute or two the conversation stopped, and
the three guards and the musketeer, after heartily shaking hands,
separated, the guards going one way and Aramis another.</p>

<p>"Now is the time to make my peace with this gentleman," said
D'Artagnan to himself, having stood on one side during all the latter
part of the conversation; and in this good spirit drawing near to
Aramis, who was going off without paying any attention to him, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will excuse me, I hope."</p>

<p>"Ah!" interrupted Aramis, "permit me to observe to you, sir, that you
have not acted in this affair as a man of good breeding ought."</p>

<p>"What!" cried D'Artagnan, "do you suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose that you are not a fool, and that you knew very well, even
though you come from Gascony, that people do not stand on
handkerchiefs for nothing. What the devil! Paris is not paved with
linen!"</p>

<p>"Sir, you do wrong in trying to humiliate me," said D'Artagnan, in
whom his native pugnacity began to speak louder than his peaceful
resolutions. "I come from Gascony, it is true; and since you know it,
there is no need to tell you that Gascons are not very patient, so
that when they have asked pardon once, even for a folly, they think
they have done at least as much again as they ought to have done."</p>

<p>"Sir, what I say to you about this matter," said Aramis, "is not for
the sake of hunting a quarrel. Thank Heaven, I am not a swashbuckler,
and being a musketeer only for a while, I only fight when I am forced
to do so, and always with great reluctance; but this time the affair
is serious, for here is a lady compromised by you."</p>

<p>"By us, you mean," cried D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"Why did you give me back the handkerchief so awkwardly?"</p>

<p>"Why did you let it fall so awkwardly?"</p>

<p>"I have said that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4981" id="Page_4981">[Pg 4981]</a></span>
"Well, by saying that you have told two lies, sir; for I saw it fall."</p>

<p>"Oh ho! you take it up that way, do you, Master Gascon? Well, I will
teach you how to behave yourself."</p>

<p>"And I will send you back to your pulpit, Master Priest. Draw, if you
please, and instantly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so, if you please, my good friend; not here, at least. Do you not
see that we are opposite Aiguillon House, full of the Cardinal's
creatures? How do I know that it is not his Eminence who has honored
you with the commission to bring him in my head? Now, I entertain an
absurd partiality for my head, it seems to suit my shoulders so
finely. I have no objection to killing you, you may be sure, but
quietly, in a snug, distant spot, where you will not be able to boast
of your death to anybody."</p>

<p>"I agree, but don't be too confident; and take away your
handkerchief&mdash;whether it belongs to you or somebody else, perhaps you
may stand in need of it to bandage up a wound. As a Gascon, I don't
put off engagements for prudence's sake."</p>

<p>"Prudence is a virtue useless enough to musketeers, I know, but
indispensable to churchmen; and as I am only a temporary musketeer, I
hold it best to be prudent. At two o'clock I shall have the honor of
expecting you at Treville's. There I will point out the best place and
time to you."</p>

<p>The two bowed and separated. Aramis went up the street which led to
the Luxembourg; while D'Artagnan, seeing that the appointed hour was
coming near, took the road to the Carmes-Deschaux, saying to himself,
"I certainly cannot hope to come out of these scrapes alive; but if I
am doomed to be killed, it will be by a royal musketeer."</p>

<h3><a name="DEFENSE" id="DEFENSE"></a>THE DEFENSE OF THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS</h3>

<h4>From 'The Three Musketeers'</h4>

<p>When D'Artagnan arrived, he found his three friends all together.
Athos was thinking deeply, Porthos was twirling his mustache, and
Aramis was reading his prayers out of a beautiful little book bound in
blue velvet.</p>

<p>"My faith, gentlemen!" exclaimed he, "I hope that what you
have to tell me is very important, or I shall owe you a grudge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4982" id="Page_4982">[Pg 4982]</a></span>
for dragging me here, out of my bed, after a whole night passed in taking and
dismantling a bastion! Ah, it is a thousand pities you were not there!
It was warm work!"</p>

<p>"We were somewhere else, where it was not very cold either," replied
Porthos, giving his mustache another twist....</p>

<p>"Aramis," said Athos, "didn't you breakfast the other day at
Parpaillot's?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Were you comfortable there?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not like it at all. It was a fast day, and they had nothing
but meat."</p>

<p>"What, no fish to be had in a seaport town?"</p>

<p>"They say," replied Aramis, taking up his book, "that they have all
taken to the deep sea, since the Cardinal built that dike."</p>

<p>"That is not what I was asking," replied Athos. "Were you quite free
and at your ease, or did any one pay attention to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nobody paid any attention to me. And if <i>that</i> is your object,
Athos, Parpaillot's will suit us very well."</p>

<p>"Let us go at once then," said Athos, "for these walls are like
paper."</p>

<p>On the way they met Grimaud [the valet of Athos], whom Athos beckoned
silently to follow them. Grimaud, according to his custom, obeyed
without a word. The poor fellow had almost forgotten how to speak!</p>

<p>It did not take them long to reach Parpaillot's, but unluckily the
hour was ill chosen for a private conference. The <i>r&eacute;veille</i> had just
been sounded, and the sleepy soldiers were all pouring into the inn.
This state of matters delighted the landlord, but was hardly so
agreeable to the four friends, who merely nodded sulkily at the
salutations of the crowd.</p>

<p>"If we are not careful," said Athos, rousing himself, "we shall find
ourselves landed in some quarrel, which would be highly inconvenient
at this moment. D'Artagnan, tell us about your night's work, and then
we will tell you about ours."</p>

<p>"Ah yes," said a light-horse soldier, who was slowly sipping a glass
of brandy, "you were down at the trenches last night, I think, and I
believe you had a brush with the Rochellois."</p>

<p>D'Artagnan looked at Athos, to see if he ought to answer or not.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4983" id="Page_4983">[Pg 4983]</a></span>
"My dear fellow," replied Athos, "I don't think you are aware that M.
De Busigny did you the honor to address you! Since these gentlemen are
interested in last night's affair, tell them about it."</p>

<p>"Is it true that you captured a bastion?" asked a Swiss, who
had filled his beer up with rum.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur," replied D'Artagnan, "we had that honor.
We also introduced a barrel of powder into a corner, which in
exploding opened a really beautiful breach; and as the bastion
was not built yesterday, the whole building was severely shaken."</p>

<p>"What bastion was it?" said a dragoon, who was holding a
goose on the point of his sword, and cooking it at the fire.</p>

<p>"The Bastion Saint-Gervais," replied D'Artagnan; "the Rochellois
behind it were always annoying our men."</p>

<p>"And there was a good deal of sharp-shooting?"</p>

<p>"A good deal. We lost five men, and the Rochellois eight or
ten."</p>

<p>"But this morning," went on the light-horseman, "they will
probably send down some pioneers to rebuild the bastion."</p>

<p>"Yes, probably," answered D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," broke in Athos, "I want to propose a bet."</p>

<p>"What bet?" asked the light-horseman.</p>

<p>"I bet you, M. De Busigny, that I and my three friends
Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, will breakfast in the Bastion
Saint-Gervais, and will hold it an hour by the clock, against all
comers."</p>

<p>Porthos and Aramis looked at each other. They were beginning
to understand what Athos had in his head.</p>

<p>"But," objected D'Artagnan, leaning over to whisper to
Athos, "we shall be killed without a chance of escape."</p>

<p>"We shall be killed a great deal more certainly if we don't
go," replied Athos.</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Porthos, twirling his mustache, "that is a
grand bet."</p>

<p>"I take it," said M. De Busigny; "let us fix the stakes."</p>

<p>"That is easily done," replied Athos. "We are four and you
are four. The loser shall give the whole eight a dinner."</p>

<p>"Very well, let us agree to that," said M. De Busigny and the
dragoon.</p>

<p>"Your breakfast is ready, gentlemen," broke in the landlord
at this instant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4984" id="Page_4984">[Pg 4984]</a></span>
"Then bring it here," answered Athos.</p>

<p>The landlord obeyed, and Athos, making a sign to Grimaud,
pointed out a large basket standing in a corner, which he was to
fill with wine and food.</p>

<p>"But where are you going to eat it?" asked the landlord.</p>

<p>"What does that matter to you as long as you are paid?"
replied Athos, throwing two pistoles on the table. Then, turning
to M. De Busigny, he observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you have the kindness, monsieur, to set your watch by
mine, or let me set mine by yours?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, monsieur," said the light-horseman, drawing out
a beautiful watch incrusted with diamonds; "half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Five-and-twenty minutes to eight. So I am five minutes
faster than you;" and bowing to the rest of the company, the
four young men took the road to the Bastion Saint-Gervais,
followed by Grimaud carrying the basket. He had not the faintest
idea where they were going, or what they were to do, but
Athos had given his orders, and he always obeyed without questioning.</p>

<p>As long as they were within the camp, the four friends remained
silent; but once they had passed the wall of circumvallation,
D'Artagnan, who was completely in the dark, thought it was time to ask
for an explanation.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear Athos," said he, "will you be good
enough to tell me where we are bound for?"</p>

<p>"Why, for the bastion, of course."</p>

<p>"And what are we to do when we get there?"</p>

<p>"I told you before. We are going to breakfast."</p>

<p>"But why didn't we do that at Parpaillot's?"</p>

<p>"Because we had some important matters to discuss, and it
was impossible to talk for five minutes at that inn, with all those
people coming and going, and perpetually bowing and speaking
to you. Here at least," continued Athos, pointing to the bastion,
"we shall not be interrupted."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said D'Artagnan, with the caution which
was as much his characteristic as his foolhardy courage, "it seems
to me that we might have found some secluded place among the
sand-hills on the sea-shore."</p>

<p>"Oh, somebody would have seen, and in a quarter of an hour
spies would have informed the Cardinal that we were holding
council."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4985" id="Page_4985">[Pg 4985]</a></span>
"Yes," said Aramis. "Athos is right. <i>Animadvertuntur in desertis.</i>"</p>

<p>"A desert would have done very well," replied Porthos; "but
first we should have to find it."</p>

<p>"There is no desert where a bird cannot fly overhead, or a
fish jump out of the water, or a rabbit run out of his hole; and
bird, fish, and rabbit have all become spies of the Cardinal.
Much better to go on with our adventure, which we cannot now
give up without dishonor. We have made a bet, and a bet on the
spur of the moment; a bet of which I defy any one to guess
the true meaning. To win it, we must hold the bastion for an
hour. Either they will attack us, or they won't. If we are left
unmolested, we shall have plenty of time to talk without any
one overhearing us, for I will answer for the walls of this bastion
having no ears. If they try to dislodge us, we can talk all
the same, and in defending our position shall cover ourselves
with glory. You see that from every point of view we have the
whip hand."</p>

<p>"Yes," said D'Artagnan, "but most certainly we shall attract
some stray bullet."</p>

<p>"My good fellow," remarked Athos, "do you really think that
the enemy's bullets are those we have most cause to fear?"</p>

<p>"But surely, if we were embarking on such an expedition, we
ought to have brought our muskets?"</p>

<p>"Porthos, you are a goose! What would be the good of burdening
ourselves with anything so useless?"</p>

<p>"I should hardly think that a heavy musket, a dozen cartridges, and
a powder flask would be useless when one is in the presence of an
enemy."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Athos, "didn't you hear what D'Artagnan
was saying?"</p>

<p>"What did D'Artagnan say?" asked Porthos.</p>

<p>"He said that during last night's attack eight or ten Frenchmen
were killed, and as many Rochellois."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, hasn't everybody been too busy ever since to think of
stripping the dead bodies?"</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"What then? Why, we shall find their muskets, their flasks,
and their cartridges, all waiting for us; and instead of four muskets
and twelve charges, there will be fifteen pieces and a hundred bullets."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4986" id="Page_4986">[Pg 4986]</a></span>
"O Athos," exclaimed Aramis, "you are a great man!"</p>

<p>Porthos nodded approval; only D'Artagnan did not seem to
be convinced; and Grimaud appeared to have his doubts, for
seeing they were still making for the bastion (which up to that
moment he had declined to believe), he plucked his master by
the coat.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" he asked by a sign.</p>

<p>Athos pointed out the bastion.</p>

<p>"But," objected Grimaud, speaking always in pantomime,
"we shall leave our bodies there."</p>

<p>Athos raised his hands and eyes to heaven. Grimaud placed
his basket on the ground and sat down, shaking his head.</p>

<p>Athos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was well
primed, cocked it, and approached the barrel to Grimaud's ear.
Grimaud was on his legs again, as if by magic. Athos then
signed to him to take up the basket and go on.</p>

<p>Grimaud obeyed.</p>

<p>When they reached the bastion, the four friends turned round
and beheld over three hundred soldiers assembled at the gate of
the camp; M. De Busigny, the dragoon, the Swiss, and their
silent companion forming a group apart.</p>

<p>Athos removed his hat, put it on the edge of his sword, and
waved it in the air.</p>

<p>The spectators returned his salute and gave a great hurrah,
which penetrated to their ears even at that distance. Then all
four disappeared inside the bastion, where Grimaud had preceded
them.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CONSULTATION" id="CONSULTATION"></a>THE CONSULTATION OF THE MUSKETEERS</h3>
<h4>From 'The Three Musketeers'</h4>

<p>As Athos had assumed, the bastion was only occupied by a
dozen dead men, French and Rochellois.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Athos, to whom the command of the
expedition naturally fell, "while Grimaud lays out breakfast, we
will begin by picking up the muskets and cartridges, and of
course there is nothing in this employment to prevent our talking.
Our friends here," he added, pointing to the dead, "will pay no
attention to us."</p>

<p>"But after we have made sure they have nothing in their
pockets, we had better throw them into the trench," said Porthos.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4987" id="Page_4987">[Pg 4987]</a></span>
"Yes," replied Athos, "that is Grimaud's business."</p>

<p>"Well then," said D'Artagnan, "let Grimaud search them,
and after he has done so, throw them over the wall."</p>

<p>"He shall do nothing of the sort," replied Athos; "we may
find them useful yet."</p>

<p>"You are going mad, my good fellow! Of what use can
these dead men be?"</p>

<p>"Don't judge hastily, say the gospel and the Cardinal," replied
Athos. "How many guns have we got?"</p>

<p>"Twelve," said Aramis.</p>

<p>"How many charges?"</p>

<p>"A hundred."</p>

<p>"That will do. Now let us load."</p>

<p>They set to work; and as they finished loading the last gun,
Grimaud made a sign that breakfast was ready.</p>

<p>By a gesture Athos replied that they were ready also, and
then pointed out a pepper-box turret, where Grimaud was to
keep watch. To help him pass the time Athos allowed him to
take some bread, two cutlets, and a bottle of wine....</p>

<p>"Now," said D'Artagnan, "that there is no chance of our
being overheard, I hope you will tell us your secret."</p>

<p>"I trust, gentlemen, to give you both pleasure and glory at
once," replied Athos. "I have made you take a charming walk,
and now here is an excellent breakfast; while below, as you may
see through the loop-holes, are five hundred persons, who consider
us to be either lunatics or heroes,&mdash;two classes of idiots
who have much in common...."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Grimaud? As the circumstances are
grave, I will allow you to speak, but be short, I beg. What
is it?"</p>

<p>"A troop."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"Twenty?"</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen pioneers, four soldiers."</p>

<p>"How far off?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred paces."</p>

<p>"Then we have just time to finish this fowl and drink your
health, D'Artagnan."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the troop hove in sight, marching along
a narrow trench that connected the bastion and the town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4988" id="Page_4988">[Pg 4988]</a></span>
"Bah!" said Athos. "It was scarcely worth while disturbing
ourselves for a mere handful of rascals armed with pickaxes,
hoes, and shovels. Grimaud had only got to make them a sign
to return whence they came, and I am sure they would have left
us in peace."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said D'Artagnan, "for they are advancing steadily.
And besides the sappers, there are four soldiers and a brigadier,
all armed with muskets."</p>

<p>"It is only because they have not seen us," replied Athos.</p>

<p>"Upon my honor," cried Aramis, "I feel quite ashamed to
fire on poor devils like that."</p>

<p>"False priest!" exclaimed Porthos, "to have pity on heretics."</p>

<p>"Aramis is right," said Athos. "I will warn them."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you doing?" said D'Artagnan. "You will
get yourself shot, my good fellow."</p>

<p>But Athos paid no attention to this remark, and mounting the breach,
his hat in one hand and his musket in the other, he addressed the
troop, who were so astonished at this unexpected apparition that they
halted about fifty paces distant. "Gentlemen," he said, bowing
courteously as he spoke, "I am at this moment breakfasting with some
friends in the shelter of this bastion. As you know, there is nothing
so unpleasant as to be disturbed during your meals; therefore we
should be greatly obliged if you would postpone any business you may
have here, till we have finished, or else call again. Unless, indeed,
you have the happy inspiration to quit the side of rebellion, and to
drink, with us, to the health of the King of France."</p>

<p>"Do take care, Athos!" exclaimed D'Artagnan; "don't you see
they are aiming at you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," said Athos; "but they are only civilians,
who don't know how to shoot; and they will never touch me."</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered the words when four muskets fired
simultaneously. The balls fell round Athos, but not one grazed
him.</p>

<p>Four muskets immediately answered, but these were better
directed than the others. Three of the soldiers fell dead, and
one of the sappers was wounded.</p>

<p>"Grimaud, another musket," said Athos, who was still on
the breach. Grimaud obeyed; a second volley was fired; the
brigadier and two pioneers fell dead, and the rest of the troop
took flight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4989" id="Page_4989">[Pg 4989]</a></span>
"Now we must make a sortie," cried Athos; and the four
comrades dashed out of the fort, picked up the muskets belonging
to the dead soldiers, and retreated to the bastion, carrying
the trophies of their victory....</p>

<p>"To arms!" called Grimaud.</p>

<p>The young men jumped up and ran for their muskets.</p>

<p>This time the advancing troop was composed of twenty or
twenty-five men, but they were no longer sappers, but soldiers
of the garrison.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better return to the camp?" said Porthos. "The
fight is not equal at all."</p>

<p>"Impossible, for three reasons," said Athos. "First, because
we haven't finished breakfast; second, because we have several
important things to discuss; and third, because there are still ten
minutes before the hour is up."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," remarked Aramis, "we had better have some
plan of campaign."</p>

<p>"It is very simple," replied Athos. "The moment the enemy
is within reach, we fire. If they still come on, we fire again,
and go on firing as long as our guns are loaded. If any of
them are left, and they try to carry the place by assault, we
will let them get well into the ditch, and then drop on their
heads a piece of the wall, that only keeps poised by a kind of
miracle."</p>

<p>"Bravo," cried Porthos. "Athos, you were born to be a general;
and the Cardinal, who thinks himself a great commander,
is not to be compared to you."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," replied Athos, "remember, one thing at a time.
Cover your man well."</p>

<p>"I have mine," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"And I," said Porthos and Aramis.</p>

<p>"Then fire;" and as Athos gave the word, the muskets rang
out and four men fell. Then the drum beat, and the little army
advanced to the charge, while all the while the fire was kept up,
irregularly, but with a sure aim. The Rochellois however did
not flinch, but came on steadily.</p>

<p>When they reached the foot of the bastion, the enemy still
numbered twelve or fifteen. A sharp fire received them, but
they never faltered, and leaping the trench, prepared to scale the
breach.</p>

<p>"Now, comrades!" cried Athos. "Let us make an end of
them. To the wall!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4990" id="Page_4990">[Pg 4990]</a></span>
And all four, aided by Grimaud, began to push with their
guns a huge block of wall, which swayed as if with the wind,
and then rolled slowly down into the trench. A horrible cry
was heard, a cloud of dust mounted upwards; and all was silent.</p>

<p>"Have we crushed them all, do you think?" asked Athos.</p>

<p>"It looks like it," answered D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"No," said Porthos, "for two or three are limping off."</p>

<p>Athos looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "an hour has elapsed since we came
here, and we have won our bet." ...</p>

<p>"What is going on in the town?" asked Athos.</p>

<p>"It is a call to arms."</p>

<p>They listened, and the sound of a drum reached their ears.</p>

<p>"They must be sending us an entire regiment," said Athos.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to fight a whole regiment?" said Porthos.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the musketeer. "If we had only had the
sense to bring another dozen bottles, I could make head against
an army!"</p>

<p>"As I live, the drum is coming nearer," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"Let it," replied Athos. "It takes a quarter of an hour to get from
here to the town, so it takes a quarter of an hour to get from the
town here. That is more than enough time for us to arrange our plans.
If we leave this, we shall never find such a good position.... But I
must first give Grimaud his orders;" and Athos made a sign to his
servant.</p>

<p>"Grimaud," said he, pointing to the dead who were lying on
the bastion, "you will take these gentlemen and prop them up
against the wall, and put their hats on their heads and their guns
in their hands."</p>

<p>"Great man!" ejaculated D'Artagnan; "I begin to see."</p>

<p>"You do?" asked Porthos.</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> understand, Grimaud?" said Aramis.</p>

<p>Grimaud nodded.</p>

<p>"Then we are all right," said Athos....</p>

<p>"On guard!" cried D'Artagnan. "Look at those red and
black points moving down there! A regiment, did you call it,
Athos?&mdash;it is a perfect army!"</p>

<p>"My word, yes!" said Athos, "there they come! How cunning
to beat neither drums nor trumpets. Are you ready, Grimaud?"</p>

<p>Grimaud silently nodded, and showed them a dozen dead men,
arranged skillfully in various attitudes, some porting arms, some
taking aim, others drawing their swords.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4991" id="Page_4991">[Pg 4991]</a></span>
"Well done!" exclaimed Athos, "it does honor to your imagination."</p>

<p>"If it is all the same to you," said Porthos, "I should like to
understand what is going on."</p>

<p>"Let us get away first," replied D'Artagnan, "and you will
understand after."</p>

<p>"One moment, please! Give Grimaud time to clear away the
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Aramis; "the red and black specks are becoming
more distinct, and I agree with D'Artagnan that we have no time
to lose before we regain the camp."</p>

<p>"Very well," rejoined Athos, "I have nothing to say against
retreating. The wager was for an hour, and we have been here
an hour and a half. Let us be off at once."</p>

<p>The four comrades went out at the back, following Grimaud,
who had already departed with the basket.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Athos, stopping suddenly, "what the devil is to
be done?"</p>

<p>"Has anything been forgotten?" asked Aramis.</p>

<p>"Our flag, man, our flag! We can't leave our flag in the
enemy's hands, if it is nothing but a napkin." And Athos dashed
again into the bastion, and bore away the flag unhurt, amid a
volley of balls from the Rochellois.</p>

<p>He waved his flag, while turning his back on the troops of
the town, and saluting those of the camp. From both sides arose
great cries, of anger on the one hand and enthusiasm on the
other, and the napkin, pierced with three bullet-holes, was in
truth transformed into a flag. "Come down, come down!" they
shouted from the camp.</p>

<p>Athos came down, and his friends, who had awaited him
anxiously, received him with joy.</p>

<p>"Be quick, Athos," said D'Artagnan; "now that we have got
everything but money, it would be stupid to get killed."</p>

<p>But Athos would not hurry himself, and they had to keep
pace with him.</p>

<p>By this time Grimaud and his basket were well beyond bullet
range, while in the distance the sounds of rapid firing might be
heard.</p>

<p>"What are they doing?" asked Porthos; "what are they
firing at?"</p>

<p>"At our dead men," replied Athos.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4992" id="Page_4992">[Pg 4992]</a></span>
"But they don't fire back."</p>

<p>"Exactly so; therefore the enemy will come to the conclusion
that there is an ambuscade. They will hold a council, and send
an envoy with a flag of truce, and when they at last find out the
joke, we shall be out of reach. So it is no use getting apoplexy
by racing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand," said Porthos, full of astonishment.</p>

<p>"That is a mercy!" replied Athos, shrugging his shoulders, as
they approached the camp, which was watching their progress in
a ferment of admiration.</p>

<p>This time a new fusillade was begun, and the balls whistled
close to the heads of the four victors and fell about their ears.
The Rochellois had entered the bastion.</p>

<p>"What bad shooting!" said D'Artagnan. "How many was it
we killed? Twelve?"</p>

<p>"Twelve or fifteen."</p>

<p>"And how many did we crush?"</p>

<p>"Eight or ten."</p>

<p>"And not a scratch to show for it."</p>

<p>"Ah, what is that on your hand, D'Artagnan? It looks to me
like blood."</p>

<p>"It's nothing," replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p>"A spent ball?"</p>

<p>"Not even that."</p>

<p>"But what is it, then?" As we have said, the silent and resolute
Athos loved D'Artagnan like his own son, and showed every
now and then all the anxiety of a father.</p>

<p>"The skin is rubbed off, that is all," said D'Artagnan. "My
fingers were caught between two stones&mdash;the stone of the wall
and the stone of my ring."</p>

<p>"That is what comes of having diamonds," remarked Athos
disdainfully....</p>

<p>"Here we are at the camp, and they are coming to meet us
and bring us in triumphantly."</p>

<p>And he only spoke the truth, for the whole camp was in a
turmoil. More than two thousand people had gazed, as at a play,
at the lucky bit of braggadocio of the four friends,&mdash;braggadocio
of which they were far from suspecting the real motive. The
cry of "Long live the musketeers," resounded on all sides, and
M. De Busigny was the first to hold out his hand to Athos and
to declare that he had lost his wager. The dragoon and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4993" id="Page_4993">[Pg 4993]</a></span>
Swiss had followed him, and all the others had followed the
dragoon and the Swiss. There was nothing but congratulations,
hand-shakings, embraces; and the tumult became so great that
the Cardinal thought there must be a revolt, and sent La Houdini&egrave;re,
his captain of guards, to find out what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the Cardinal, as his messenger returned.</p>

<p>"Well, monseigneur," replied La Houdini&egrave;re, "it is about
three musketeers and a guardsman who made a bet with M. De
Busigny to go and breakfast at the Bastion Saint-Gervais, and
while breakfasting, held it for two hours against the enemy, and
killed I don't know how many Rochellois."</p>

<p>"You asked the names of these gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Athos, Porthos, and Aramis."</p>

<p>"Always my three heroes," murmured the Cardinal. "And
the guardsman?"</p>

<p>"M. D'Artagnan."</p>

<p>"Always my young rogue! I must gain over these men."</p>

<p>And the same evening, the Cardinal had a conversation with
M. De Treville about the morning's exploit, with which the whole
camp was still ringing. M. De Treville, who had heard it all
at first hand, gave his Eminence all the details, not forgetting
the episode of the napkin.</p>

<p>"Very good, M. De Treville," said the Cardinal; "but you
must get me that napkin, and I will have three golden lilies embroidered
on it, and give as a banner to your company."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," replied M. De Treville, "that would be an
injustice to the guards. M. D'Artagnan does not belong to me,
but to M. Des Essarts."</p>

<p>"Then you must take him," said the Cardinal. "As these
four brave soldiers love each other so much, they ought certainly
to be in the same regiment."</p>

<p>That evening M. De Treville announced the good news to the
three musketeers and to D'Artagnan, and invited them all to
breakfast the following day.</p>

<p>D'Artagnan was nearly beside himself with joy. As we know,
it had been the dream of his life to be a musketeer.</p>

<h3><a name="IRONMASK" id="IRONMASK"></a>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK</h3>
<h4>From 'The Viscount of Bragelonne'</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Dumas adopts the theory that the Man in the Iron Mask was the suppressed
twin brother of Louis XIV.]</p></div>

<p>"What is all this noise?" asked Philippe, turning towards the door of
the concealed staircase. And as he spoke a voice was heard saying,
"This way, this way. Still a few steps, sire."</p>

<p>"It is M. Fouquet's voice," said D'Artagnan, who was standing
near the Queen Mother.</p>

<p>"Then M. D'Herblay will not be far off," added Philippe;
but little did he expect to see the person who actually entered.</p>

<p>All eyes were riveted on the door, from which the voice of
M. Fouquet proceeded; but it was not he who came through.</p>

<p>A cry of anguish rang through the room, breaking forth
simultaneously from the King and the spectators, and surely
never had been seen a stranger sight.</p>

<p>The shutters were half closed, and only a feeble light struggled
through the velvet curtains, with their thick silk linings,
and the eyes of the courtiers had to get accustomed to the darkness
before they could distinguish between the surrounding objects.
But once discerned, they stood out as clear as day.</p>

<p>So, looking up, they saw Louis XIV. in the doorway of the
private stair, his face pale and his brows bent; and behind him
stood Fouquet.</p>

<p>The Queen Mother, whose hand held that of Philippe, uttered
a shriek at the sight, thinking that she beheld a ghost.</p>

<p>Monsieur staggered for a moment and turned away his head,
looking from the King who was facing him to the King who was
by his side.</p>

<p>Madame on the contrary stepped forward, thinking it must
be her brother-in-law reflected in a mirror. And indeed, this
seemed the only rational explanation of the double image.</p>

<p>Both young men, agitated and trembling, clenching their
hands, darting flames of fury from their eyes, dumb, breathless,
ready to spring at each other's throats, resembled each other so
exactly in feature, figure, and even, by pure accident, in dress,
that Anne of Austria herself stood confounded. For as yet the
truth had not dawned on her. There are some torments that we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4995" id="Page_4995">[Pg 4995]</a></span>
all instinctively reject. It is easier far to accept the supernatural,
the impossible.</p>

<p>That he should encounter such obstacles had never for one
moment occurred to Louis. He imagined he had only to show
himself, for the world to fall at his feet. The Sun-king could
have no rival; and where his rays did not fall, there must be
darkness&mdash;</p>

<p>As to Fouquet, who could describe his bewilderment at the
sight of the living portrait of his master? Then he thought
that Aramis was right, and that the new-comer was every whit
as much a king as his double, and that after all, perhaps he
had made a mistake when he had declined to share in the <i>coup
d'&eacute;tat</i> so cleverly plotted by the General of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>And then, it was equally the blood royal of Louis XIII. that
Fouquet had determined to sacrifice to blood in all respects identical;
a noble ambition, to one that was selfish. And it was the
mere aspect of the pretender which showed him all these things.</p>

<p>D'Artagnan, leaning against the wall and facing Fouquet, was
debating in his own mind the key to this wonderful riddle. He
felt instinctively, though he could not have told why, that in
the meeting of the two Louis XIV's lay the explanation of all
that had seemed suspicious in the conduct of Aramis during the
last few days.</p>

<p>Suddenly Louis XIV., by nature the most impatient of the
two young men, and with the habit of command that was the
result of training, strode across the room and flung open one of
the shutters. The flood of light that streamed through the window
caused Philippe involuntarily to recoil, and to step back
into the shelter of an alcove.</p>

<p>The movement struck Louis, and turning to the Queen he said:</p>

<p>"Mother, do you not know your own son, although every one
else has denied his King?"</p>

<p>Anne trembled at his voice and raised her arms to heaven,
but could not utter a single word.</p>

<p>"Mother," retorted Philippe in his quietest tones, "do you
not know your own son?"</p>

<p>And this time it was Louis who stepped back.</p>

<p>As for Anne, pierced to the heart with grief and remorse,
she could bear it no longer. She staggered where she stood, and
unaided by her attendants, who seemed turned into stone, she
sank down on a sofa with a sigh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4996" id="Page_4996">[Pg 4996]</a></span>
This spectacle was too much for Louis. He rushed to D'Artagnan, whose
brain was going round with bewilderment, and who clung to the door as
his last hope.</p>

<p>"To me, musketeer! Look us both in the face, and see
which is the paler, he or I."</p>

<p>The cry awoke D'Artagnan from his stupor, and struck the
chord of obedience strong in the bosom of every soldier. He
lifted his head, and striding straight up to Philippe laid his hand
on his shoulder, saying quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you are my prisoner."</p>

<p>Philippe remained absolutely still, as if nailed to the floor,
his eyes fixed despairingly on the King who was his brother.
His silence reproached him as no words could have done, with
the bitterness of the past and the tortures of the future.</p>

<p>And the King understood, and his soul sank within him. His
eyes fell, and drawing his brother and sister-in-law with him, he
hastily quitted the room; forgetting in his agitation even his
mother, lying motionless on the couch beside him, not three
paces from the son whom for the second time she was allowing
to be condemned to a death in life.</p>

<p>Philippe drew near to her, and said softly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you had not been my mother, madame, I must have
cursed you for the misery you have caused me."</p>

<p>D'Artagnan overheard, and a shiver of pity passed through
him. He bowed respectfully to the young prince, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Forgive me, monseigneur; I am only a soldier, and my faith
is due to him who has left us."</p>

<p>"Thank you, M. D'Artagnan. But what has become of M.
D'Herblay?"</p>

<p>"M. D'Herblay is safe, monseigneur," answered a voice behind
them; "and while I am alive and free, not a hair of his head
shall be hurt."</p>

<p>"M. Fouquet!" said the prince, smiling sadly.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, monseigneur," cried Fouquet, falling on his
knees; "but he who has left the room was my guest."</p>

<p>"Ah!" murmured Philippe to himself with a sigh, "you are
loyal friends and true hearts. You make me regret the world I
am leaving. M. D'Artagnan, I will follow you."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Colbert entered and handed to the captain of
the musketeers an order from the King; then bowed, and went
out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4997" id="Page_4997">[Pg 4997]</a></span>
D'Artagnan glanced at the paper, and in a sudden burst of
wrath crumpled it in his hand.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the prince.</p>

<p>"Read it, monseigneur," answered the musketeer.</p>

<p>And Philippe read these words, written hastily by the King
himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"M. D'Artagnan will conduct the prisoner to the &Icirc;les
Sainte-Marguerite. He will see that his face is covered with an iron
mask, which must never be lifted on pain of death."</p>

<p>"It is just," said Philippe; "I am ready."</p>

<p>"Aramis was right," whispered Fouquet to D'Artagnan, "this
is as good a king as the other."</p>

<p>"Better," replied D'Artagnan; "he only needed you and me."</p>

<h3><a name="TRICK" id="TRICK"></a>A TRICK IS PLAYED ON HENRY III. BY AID OF CHICOT</h3>
<h4>From 'The Lady of Monsoreau'</h4>

<p>The King and Chicot remained quiet and silent for the next ten
minutes. Then suddenly the King sat up, and the noise he made roused
Chicot, who was just dropping off to sleep.</p>

<p>The two looked at each other with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Chicot in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that sighing sound?" replied the King in a
lower voice still. "Listen!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, one of the wax candles in the hand of the
golden satyr went out; then a second, then a third. After a
moment, the fourth went out also.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" cried Chicot, "that is more than a sighing sound."
But he had hardly uttered the last word when in its turn the
lamp was extinguished, and the room was in darkness, save for
the flickering glow of the dying embers.</p>

<p>"Look out!" exclaimed Chicot, jumping up.</p>

<p>"He is going to speak," said the King, shrinking back into
his bed.</p>

<p>"Then listen and let us hear what he says," replied Chicot,
and at the same instant a voice which sounded at once both
piercing and hollow, proceeded from the space between the bed
and the wall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4998" id="Page_4998">[Pg 4998]</a></span>
"Hardened sinner, are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Lord." gasped Henri with chattering teeth.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" remarked Chicot, "that is a very hoarse voice
to have come from heaven! I feel dreadfully frightened; but
never mind!"</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" asked the voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord," stammered Henri; "and I bow before your
anger."</p>

<p>"Do you think you are carrying out my will by performing
all the mummeries you have taken part in to-day, while your
heart is full of the things of this world?"</p>

<p>"Well said!" cried Chicot; "you touched him there!"</p>

<p>The King's hands shook as he clasped them, and Chicot went
up to him.</p>

<p>"Well," murmured Henri, "are you convinced now?"</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," answered Chicot.</p>

<p>"What do you want more?"</p>

<p>"Hush! listen to me. Creep softly out of bed, and let me
take your place."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because then the anger of the Lord will fall first upon me."</p>

<p>"And do you think I shall escape?"</p>

<p>"We will try, anyway;" and with affectionate persistence he
pushed the King out of bed, and took his place.</p>

<p>"Now, Henri," he said, "go and lie on my sofa, and leave all
to me."</p>

<p>Henri obeyed; he began to understand Chicot's plan.</p>

<p>"You are silent," continued the voice, "which proves that
your heart is hardened."</p>

<p>"Oh, pardon, pardon, Lord!" exclaimed Chicot, imitating the
King's nasal twang. Then, stretching himself out of bed, he
whispered to the King, "It is very odd, but the heavenly voice
does not seem to know that it is Chicot who is speaking."</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied Henri, "what do you suppose is the meaning
of that?"</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry; plenty of strange things will happen
yet!"</p>

<p>"Miserable creature that you are!" went on the voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord, yes!" answered Chicot. "I am a horrible sinner,
hardened in crime."</p>

<p>"Then confess your sins, and repent."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4999" id="Page_4999">[Pg 4999]</a></span>
"I acknowledge," said Chicot, "that I dealt wickedly by my
cousin Cond&eacute;, whose wife I betrayed; and I repent bitterly."</p>

<p>"What is that you are saying?" cried the King. "There
is no good in mentioning that. It has all been forgotten long
ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, has it?" replied Chicot; "then we will pass on to something
else."</p>

<p>"Answer," said the voice.</p>

<p>"I acknowledge," said the false Henri, "that I behaved like a
thief toward the Poles, who had elected me their king, in stealing
away to France one fine night, carrying with me all the
crown jewels; and I repent bitterly."</p>

<p>"Idiot!" exclaimed Henri, "what are you talking about now?
Nobody remembers anything about that."</p>

<p>"Let me alone," answered Chicot, "I must go on pretending
to be the King."</p>

<p>"Speak," said the voice.</p>

<p>"I acknowledge," continued Chicot, "that I snatched the
throne from my brother D'Alen&ccedil;on, who was the rightful heir,
since I had formally renounced my claims when I was elected
King of Poland; I repent bitterly."</p>

<p>"Rascal!" cried the King.</p>

<p>"There is yet something more," said the voice.</p>

<p>"I acknowledge to have plotted with my excellent mother,
Catherine de' Medicis, to hunt from France my brother-in-law
the King of Navarre, after first destroying all his friends, and
my sister Queen Marguerite, after first destroying all her lovers;
and I repent bitterly."</p>

<p>"Scoundrel! Cease!" muttered the King, his teeth clenched
in anger.</p>

<p>"Sire, it is no use trying to hide what Providence knows as
well as we do."</p>

<p>"There is a crime unconfessed that has nothing to do with
politics," said the voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, now we are getting to it," observed Chicot dolefully; "it
is about my conduct, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"It is," answered the voice.</p>

<p>"I cannot deny," continued Chicot, always speaking in the
name of the King, "that I am very effeminate, very lazy; a
hopeless trifler, an incorrigible hypocrite."</p>

<p>"It is true," said the voice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5000" id="Page_5000">[Pg 5000]</a></span>
"I have behaved ill to all women, to my own wife in particular;
and such a good wife too."</p>

<p>"A man should love his wife as himself, and above all the
world," cried the voice angrily.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" wailed Chicot in despairing tones; "then I certainly
have sinned terribly."</p>

<p>"And by your example you have caused others to sin."</p>

<p>"That is true, sadly true."</p>

<p>"You very nearly sent that poor Saint-Luc to perdition."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Chicot, "are you sure I did not send him there
quite?"</p>

<p>"No; but such a fate may befall both of you if you do not
let him go back to his family at break of day."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Chicot to the King, "the voice seems to
take a great interest in the house of Coss&eacute;."</p>

<p>"If you disobey me, you will suffer the same torments as
Sardanapalus, Nabuchodnosor, and the Marshal De Retz."</p>

<p>Henry III. gave a loud groan; at this threat he became more
frightened than ever.</p>

<p>"I am lost," he ejaculated wildly; "I am lost. That voice
from on high will be my death-warrant."</p>

<h2><a name="ALEXANDRE_DUMAS_JUNIOR" id="ALEXANDRE_DUMAS_JUNIOR"></a>ALEXANDRE DUMAS, JUNIOR</h2>

<h4>(1824-1895)</h4>

<h4>BY FRANCISQUE SARCEY</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/capw343.png" width="90" height="90" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><p class="dropcap">e shall not say much about the life of Alexandre Dumas the
younger. The history of a great writer is the history of his
works. He was born in Paris, on July 27th, 1824. His name
on the register of births appears as "Alexandre, son of Marie Catherine
Lebay, seamstress." He was not acknowledged by his father
until he had reached his sixth year, March 7th, 1830. I emphasize
this particular because it had great influence on the bent of his
genius. During all his life Dumas was haunted by a desire of rehabilitating
illegitimate children, of creating a reaction against their
treatment by the Civil Code and the prejudice which makes of them
something little better than outcasts in society.</p>

<p>"When seven years old," he himself says, "I entered as a boarder
the school of Monsieur Vauthier, on Rue Montagne Saint-Genevi&egrave;ve.
Thence I passed, about two years later, to the Saint-Victor School;
the principal was Monsieur Goubaux, a friend of my father, with
whom he collaborated under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Dinaux. This
school, which numbered two hundred and fifty boarding pupils, and
with the rather strange habits which I tried to depict in 'The Cl&eacute;menceau
Case,' occupied all the ground covered to-day by the Casino
de Paris and the 'P&ocirc;le-Nord' establishment. When about fifteen I left
the Saint-Victor School for Monsieur H&eacute;non's school, which was situated
in the Rue de Courcelles and has now disappeared. It is in the
Coll&ecirc;ge Bourbon (now the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet) that I received all my
instruction, as the pupils of the two schools where I lived attended
the college classes. I never belonged to any of the higher State
schools,&mdash;I have not even the degree of bachelor."</p>

<p>At the end of his years of study he returned to his father. He
did not stay there more than six months. The rather tumultuous life
which he saw in the house disturbed his proud mind, already filled
with serious yearnings.</p>

<p>"You have debts," his father said to him. "Do as I do: work,
and you will pay them."</p>

<p>Such was indeed the young man's intention. His first work was a
one-act play in verse, 'The Queen's Jewel,' which no one, assuredly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5002" id="Page_5002">[Pg 5002]</a></span>
would mention to-day but for his signature. The date was 1845, and
the author was then twenty-one. Other works by him were published
at various times in the Journal des Demoiselles.</p>

<p>"I was," he has said, "the careless, lazy, and spoilt child of all
my father's friends. I believed in the eternity of youth, of strength,
of joy. I spent the whole day laughing, the whole night sleeping,
unless I had some reason for writing verses."</p>

<p>About 1846 he set resolutely to work. He turned to novel-writing,
which seemed to him to offer greater facilities for reaching the
public and greater chances of immediate income than dramatic
composition. Only two of his novels have survived: 'La Dame aux
Cam&eacute;lias' ('Camille': 1848), because from this book came the immortal
drama by the same title; and 'The Cl&eacute;menceau Case,' because the author
wrote it when he was in complete possession of his talent, and because
moreover it is a first-rate work.</p>

<p>It was in 1852 that the Vaudeville Theatre gave the first performance
of 'Camille,' the fortune of which was to be so extraordinary.
For two or three years the play had been tossed from theatre to
theatre. Nobody wanted it. To the ideas of the time it seemed
simply shocking, and the play was still forbidden in London after its
performances in France were numbered by the hundreds.</p>

<p>There is this special trait in 'Camille'&mdash;it was a work all instinct
with the spirit of youth. Dumas twenty years later sadly said:
"I might perhaps make another 'Demi-Monde'; I could not make
another 'Camille.'" There existed, indeed, other works which have
all the fire and charm of the twentieth year. 'Polyeucte' is Corneille's
masterpiece; his 'Cid' breathes the spirit of youth: Corneille
at forty could not have written the 'Cid.' Racine's first play is
'Andromaque': Beaumarchais's is the 'Barber of Seville'; Rossini,
when young, enlivened it with his light and sparkling airs. Fifteen
years later he himself wrote his 'William Tell,' a higher work, but a
work which was not young.</p>

<p>If the theatrical managers had recoiled from 'Camille' in spite of
the great names that recommended it, it is because it was cut after
a pattern to which neither they nor the public were accustomed; it
is because it contained the germ of a whole dramatic revolution.
Now, the author was not a theatrical revolutionist. He had not said
to himself, "I am going to throw down the old fabric of the drama,
and erect a new one on its ruins." To tell the truth, he had no
idea of what he was doing. He had witnessed a love drama. He
had thrown it still throbbing upon the stage, without any regard for
the dramatic conventions which were then imposed upon playwrights,
and which were almost accepted as laws. He had simply depicted
what he had seen. All the managers, attached as they were to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5003" id="Page_5003">[Pg 5003]</a></span>
old customs, and respectful of the traditions, had trembled with horror
when they saw moving around Camille the ignoble Prudence, the
idiotic Due de Varville, the silly Saint-Gaudens. But the public&mdash;though
the fact was suspected neither by them nor by the public
itself&mdash;yearned for more truth upon the boards. When 'Camille'
was presented to them, the play-goers uttered a cry of astonishment
and joy: that was the thing! that was just what they wanted!
From that day, which will remain as a date in the history of the
French stage, the part of Camille has been performed by all the
celebrated actresses. The part has two sides: one may see in it a
degraded woman who has fallen profoundly in love, rather late in
life; one may also see in it a woman, already poetical in her own
nature, suddenly carried away by a great passion into the sacred
regions of the Ideal.</p>

<p>Almost any young man in Dumas's place would have lost his head
after so astounding a success, and might not have resisted the temptation
of at once working out the vein. For on coming out of the
theatre after the first performance, the author had all the managers
at his feet, and the smallest trifle was sure to be accepted if it only
had his signature. But he had learned, by the side of "a prodigal
father," the art of husbanding his talent. He declined to front the
footlights again, save with a work upon which he had been able to
bestow all the care and labor it deserved: he waited a year before
he gave, at the Gymnase theatre, 'Diane de Lys.'</p>

<p>'Diane de Lys' undoubtedly pleased the public, but its success was not
exactly brilliant. It is full of great qualities, it is strongly
conceived, constructed with rare power and logic, but it added nothing
to his reputation. The play as a whole seemed long and melancholy. It
is a curious subject for critical study, as one of the stages in which
the genius of the author stopped awhile, on its way to higher works.
It will leave no great trace in his career.</p>

<p>Two years later he gave at the Gymnase theatre&mdash;I do not dare
to say his masterpiece, but certainly the best constructed and most
enjoyable play he ever wrote, 'Le Demi-Monde' (The Other Half-World).
In this play he discovered and defined the very peculiar
world of those women who live on the margin of regular "society,"
and try to preserve its tone and demeanor. What scientific and
strong construction are here! What an admirable disposition of the
scenes, both flexible and logical! And through the action, which
moves on with wonderful straightforwardness and breadth, how many
portraits, drawn with a steady hand, each one bearing such distinctive
features that you would know them if you met them on the street!
Olivier de Jalin, the refined Parisian, the dialectician of the play,
who is no other than Dumas himself; Raymond de Nanjac, handsome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5004" id="Page_5004">[Pg 5004]</a></span>
and honest, but not keen or Parisian; and that giddy Valentine de
Sanctis, whose head turns with the wind, whose tongue cannot rest
one moment; and especially Suzanne d'Ange, so witty, so complex, so
devious in her motions, so <i>roublarde</i>, as a Parisian of to-day would say.</p>

<p>Between 'The Demi-Monde,' and 'La Question d'Argent' (The
Money Question), which followed, Dumas spent two years at work.
'La Question d'Argent' is a favorite play with the connoisseurs; but
its reception by the public was of the coldest. It is a noteworthy
fact that plays turning upon money have never been successful.
Le Sage's 'Turcaret' is a dramatic masterpiece: it never had the
luck to please the crowd. Dumas's Jean Giraud is, however, a very
curiously studied character. The author has represented in him the
commonest type of the shady money-man, the unconscious rascal.
And very skillfully he made an individual out of that general type,
by giving to Jean Giraud a certain rough good-nature; the appearance
of a good fellow, with a certain degree of fineness; a mixture
of humility and self-conceit, of awkwardness and impudence, and
even some ideas as to the power of money that do not lack dignity,
and some real liberality of sentiment and act,&mdash;for wealth alone,
though acquired by ignominious means, suggests and dictates to the
great robbers some advantageous movements which the small rascal
cannot indulge in: and around this Turcaret of the Second Empire
how many pictures of honest people, every one of whom, in his or
her way, is good and fine!</p>

<p>One year later Dumas carried to the Gymnase, his favorite theatre,
'Le Fils Naturel' (The Natural Son); and the next year 'Un P&egrave;re
Prodigue' (A Prodigal Father; known also in English through a free
adaptation as 'My Awful Dad').</p>

<p>In 'Le Fils Naturel' Dumas for the first time wrote a theme-play,
a kind of work in which he was to become a master. Hitherto we
have seen him drawing pictures of manners. To be sure, philosophical
considerations on the period depicted are not wanting, but the
play has not the form and does not assume the movement of a thesis.
It does not take up one special trait of our social order, one of our
worldly prejudices, in order to show its strong and weak sides. 'Le
Fils Naturel' is the work of a moralist as well as of a playwright; or
rather, it is the work of a playwright who was a born moralist.</p>

<p>'Un P&egrave;re Prodigue' originally excited great curiosity. It escaped
no one that in his Count Fernand de la Rivonni&egrave;re, Dumas had shown
us some traits of his illustrious father, who <i>had</i> been a prodigal father;
and that he had depicted himself in Viscount Andr&eacute;. Every one made
comparisons; some, of course, accused the author of filial disrespect.
The accusation was ridiculous, and he did not even answer it. He
had so well disguised the persons, he had transported them into such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5005" id="Page_5005">[Pg 5005]</a></span>
different surroundings, that no one could recognize in them their
true prototypes. Then&mdash;and this is no small praise&mdash;if Count de la
Rivonni&egrave;re is guilty of one fault, that of throwing to the wind his
fortune, he is a most amiable nobleman, full of broad ideas and generous
sentiments,&mdash;has a warm heart. The fourth act, in which the
father sacrifices himself in order to save his son's life, is pathetic in
the extreme. But nothing equals the first act, which is a model of
animated and picturesque composition. No one ever painted in more
vivid colors the pillage of a household, and a family without so much
as a shadow of discipline. It is an accumulation of small details, not
one of which is of an indifferent nature, and which, taken together,
drive into our minds the idea that this nobleman, so well-mannered,
so charming in conversation, so sober for himself, is running to ruin
as gayly as he can.</p>

<p>For four years after the production of 'Un P&egrave;re Prodigue' Dumas wrote
nothing. But in 1864 he reappeared at the Gymnase with a strange play,
'L'Ami des Femmes' (A Friend of the Sex), which completely failed.
After 'L'Ami des Femmes' there was another interruption, not of
Dumas's labors but of his dramatic production. Perhaps he was sick of
an art which had caused him a cruel disappointment. He turned again to
novel-writing, and published (1866) 'L'Affaire Cl&eacute;menceau' (The
Cl&eacute;menceau Case), the success of which was not as great as he had
hoped. In France, when a man is superior in one specialty people will
not let him leave it. He is not allowed to be at once an unequaled
novelist and a first-rate dramatist.</p>

<p>At that time Dumas hesitated which road to follow. An incident
which created a great deal of comment threw him back towards the
stage, and towards a new form of comedy.</p>

<p>M. &Eacute;mile de Girardin, one of the best known publicists of the Second
Empire, had bethought himself, when over fifty years of age, and
knowing nothing of this kind of work, to write a play. He had been
a great friend of Dumas p&egrave;re, and had kept up the most affectionate
intercourse with his son. He had asked him to fit his play for the
stage. It possessed one really dramatic idea. Dumas, in order to
oblige his father's friend, made out of it 'Le Supplice d'une Femme'
(A Woman's Torture). &Eacute;mile de Girardin, who was self-conceited and
somewhat despotic, refused to recognize his offspring in the bear that
Dumas had licked. He declined to sign the play: "Neither shall I,"
Dumas retorted.</p>

<p>'A Woman's Torture' was acted at the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise with
extraordinary success. This success was for Dumas a warning and a
lesson. 'A Woman's Torture' was a three-act play, short, concise,
panting, which hurried to the <i>coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i> of the second act, upon
which the drama revolved, and rushed to its conclusion. The time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5006" id="Page_5006">[Pg 5006]</a></span>
of five-act comedies, with ample expositions, copious developments,
philosophical disquisitions, curious and fanciful episodes, was gone.
Henceforth the dramatist had to deal with a hurried and <i>blas&eacute;</i> public,
which, taking dinner at eight, could give to the theatre but a short
time, and an attention disturbed by the labor of digestion. 'A Woman's
Torture,' which lasted only an hour and a half, and proceeded
only by rapid strokes, was exactly what that public wanted. After
that time Dumas wrote only three-act and one-act plays; using four
acts only for 'Les Id&eacute;es de Madame Aubray' (Madame Aubray's
Ideas); and these four acts are very short. In 1867 this play announced
Dumas's return to the stage; and Dumas is here more paradoxical
than he had ever been. His theme looked like a wager not
simply against bourgeois prejudices, but even against good sense, and,
I dare to say, against justice. This wager was won by Dumas, thanks
to an incredible display of skill. He took up the thesis a second
time in 'Denise,' and won his wager again, but with less difficulty.
In 'Denise' the lover struggles only against social prejudices, and
allows himself to be carried away by one of those emotional fits
which disturb and confound human reason. In 'Madame Aubray's
Ideas' the triumph is one of pure logic.</p>

<p>'Une Visite de Noces' (A Wedding Call) and 'La Princesse
Georges' followed rather closely on 'Madame Aubray's Ideas.' 'A
Wedding Call'!&mdash;what a thunderbolt then! It was of but one act,
<i>but</i> one act the effect of which was prodigious, the echo of which is
still heard. Time and familiarity have now softened for us the too
sharp outlines of this bitter play. It has been acknowledged a
masterpiece. It is certainly one of the boldest works of this extraordinary
magician, who, thanks to his unerring skill and to the dazzling
wit of his dialogue, brought the public to listen to whatever he
chose to put upon the stage. It seemed that, like a lion tamer in
the arena, Dumas took pleasure in belaboring and exasperating this
many-headed monster, in order to prove to his own satisfaction that
he could subdue its revolts.</p>

<p>'La Princesse Georges' is a work of violent and furious passion.
We find in it Madame de Terremonde, the good woman who adores
her husband, but who adores him with fury, who wants him all to
herself, and who, when sure that she is betrayed, passes from the
most exasperated rage to tears and despair. There is in the first
act a scene of exposition which has become celebrated. No one ever
so rapidly mastered the public; no one ever from the first stroke so
painfully twisted the heart of the spectators.</p>

<p>Let us pass rapidly over 'La Femme de Claude' (Claude's Wife:
1873). Of all his plays it is the one Dumas said he liked best, the
one he most passionately defended with all sorts of commentaries,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5007" id="Page_5007">[Pg 5007]</a></span>
letters, prefaces, etc.; the one which he insisted on having revived, a
long time after it had failed. To my mind that play was a mistake;
and the public, in spite of Dumas's arguments, in spite of the protests
of the critics, who are often very glad to distinguish themselves
by not yielding to the common voice,&mdash;the public insisted on agreeing
with me.</p>

<p>Only a few months later, Dumas brilliantly retrieved himself with
'Monsieur Alphonse.' His Madame Guichard is the most cheerfully
vulgar type of the <i>parvenue</i> which any one ever dared to put upon
the stage. She can hardly read and write; she is no longer young,
and she is "to boot" very proud of her money; she has no tact and
no taste; but at heart she is a good sort of woman. Her morality is
as primitive as her education. But deceit disgusts her; she hates but
one thing, she says,&mdash;lying. She is not troubled by conventionalities;
and her speech has all the color and energy of popular speech. But
see! Dumas in depicting this woman preserved exquisite measure.
Madame Guichard says many pert and droll things; she never utters
a coarse word. Her language is picturesque; it is free from slang.
Hers is a vulgar nature, but she does not offend delicate ears by the
grossness of her utterance. Dumas never drew a more living picture;
she is the joy of this rather sad play.</p>

<p>All that remain to be reviewed are 'L'&Eacute;trang&egrave;re,' 'La Princesse
de Bagdad,' and 'Fran&ccedil;illon'; all of which were given at the Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise. 'L'&Eacute;trang&egrave;re' is indeed a melodrama, with an admixture
of comedy. Had he gone further in that direction, Dumas might have
made a new sort of play, which would perhaps have reigned a long
time on the stage. But after this trial, successful though it was, he
stopped. 'La Princesse de Bagdad' entirely failed. 'Fran&ccedil;illon'
was Dumas's last success at the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise.</p>

<p>After 1887 Dumas gave nothing to the stage. He had completed
a great five-act play, 'The Road to Thebes,' which the manager of
the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise hoped every year to put on the boards.
Dumas kept promising it; but either from distrust of himself or of
the public, or from fatigue, or fear of meeting with failure, he asked
for new delays, until the day when he declared that not only the
play would not be acted during his life, but that he would not even
allow it to be acted after his death.</p>

<p>This death he saw coming, with sad but calm eyes. It was a
sorrow for us to see this man, whom we had known so quick and
alert, grow weaker every day, showing the progress of disease in his
shriveled features and body. The complexion had lost all color, the
cheeks had become flaccid, the eye had no life left.</p>

<p>On October 1st, 1895, he wrote to his friend Jules Claretie:&mdash;"Do
not depend upon me any more; I am vanquished. There are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5008" id="Page_5008">[Pg 5008]</a></span>
moments when I mourn my loss, as Madame D'Houdetot said when
dying." He was at Puys, by the seaside, when he wrote that despairing
letter. He returned to Marly, there to die, surrounded by his
family, on November 28th, 1895, in a house which he loved and
which had been bequeathed to him years before by an intimate
friend.</p>

<p>His loss threw into mourning the world of letters, and the whole
of Paris. People discovered then&mdash;for death loosens every tongue
and every pen&mdash;how kind and generous in reality was Dumas, who
had often been accused of avarice by those who contrasted him with
his father; how many services he had discreetly rendered, how open
his hand always was. His constant cheerfulness and good-nature
had finally caused him to be forgiven for his wit, which was sarcastic
and cutting, and for his success, which had thrown so many rivals
into the shade. This witty man, who was always obliging and even
tender-hearted, had no envy, and gave his applause without a shadow
of reserve to the successes of others. Every young author found in
him advice and support; he did not expect gratitude, and therefore
was soured by no disappointment. He was a good man, partly from
nature, partly from determination; for he deemed that, after all, the
best way to live happy in this world is to make happy as many
people as possible.</p>

<p>If in this long essay I have not spoken of Dumas as a moralist, it
is because, in my opinion, in spite of all that has been said, Dumas
was a dramatist a great deal more than a philosopher. In his comedies
he discussed a great many moral and social questions, without
giving a solution for any; or rather, the solutions that he gave were
due not to any set of fixed principles, but to the conclusion which he
was preparing for this play or that. He said, indifferently, "Kill her"
or "Forgive her," according to the requirements of the subject which
he had selected; and he would afterwards write a sensational preface
with a view to demonstrate that the solution this time given by him
was the only legitimate one. These prefaces are very amusing reading;
for he wrote them with all the fire of his nature, and he had
the gift of movement. But they were a strange medley of incongruous
and contradictory statements. Every idea that he expresses can
be grasped and understood; but it is impossible to see how it agrees
with those that precede and follow. It is a chaos of clear ideas.</p>

<p>Dumas was not a philosopher, but an agitator. He stirred up a
great many questions; he drew upon them our distracted attention;
he compelled us to think of them. Therein he did his duty as a
dramatist.</p>

<p>He gave much thought to the fate of woman in our civilization.
We may say, however, that though loving her much, he still more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5009" id="Page_5009">[Pg 5009]</a></span>
feared her, and I shall even add, despised her. All his characters
who have the mission of defending morality and good sense are very
attentive to her, but keep her at arm's-length. They are affectionate
counselors, not lovers. They hold her to be a frail being, who must
be controlled and guided. Some one has said that there was in
Dumas something of the Catholic priest. It is true. He was to
women a lay director of conscience.</p>

<p>He was a great connoisseur of pictures and a great art lover.
Music, I think, is the only art that did not affect him much. He was
a dazzling talker; his plays teem with bright sayings; his conversation
sparkled with them. I did not know him in his prime, when he
delighted his friends and companions by his unceasing flow of spirits.
I became intimate with him only later. If you knew how to start
him, he simply coruscated. I never knew any one, save Edmond
About, who was as witty, and who, like About, always paid you back
in good sounding coin.</p>

<p>Dumas was a member of the French Academy. He had not
wished for that honor, because it had been denied to his father. He
desired, in his reception speech, to call up the great spirit of this
illustrious father and make it share his academician's chair. He had
this joy; the two Dumas were received on the same day. Their two
names will never perish.</p>

<h3><a name="PLAYWRIGHT" id="PLAYWRIGHT"></a>THE PLAYWRIGHT IS BORN&mdash;AND MADE</h3>
<h4>From the Preface to 'A Prodigal Father'</h4>

<p>Of all the various forms of thought, the stage is that which nearest
approaches the plastic arts&mdash;inasmuch as we cannot work in it unless
we know its material processes; but with this difference: that in the
other arts one learns these processes, while in play-writing one
guesses them; or to speak more accurately, they are in us to begin
with.</p>

<p>One can become a painter, a sculptor, a musician, by sheer
study: one does not become a dramatic author in this fashion. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5010" id="Page_5010">[Pg 5010]</a></span>
caprice of nature makes your eye in such a way that you can
see a thing after a particular manner, not absolutely correct, but
which must nevertheless appear, to any other persons that you
wish to have so think, the only correct point of view. The man
really called to write for the stage reveals what is an extremely
rare faculty, in his very first attempts,&mdash;say in a farce in school,
or a drawing-room charade. There is a sort of science of optics
and of perspective that enables one to draw a personage, a character,
a passion, an impulse of the soul, with a single stroke of
the pen. Dramatic <i>cheating of the eye</i> is so complete that often
the spectator, when he is a mere reader of the play, desiring to
give himself once more the same emotion that he has felt as one
of the audience, not only cannot recapture that emotion in the
written words before him, but often cannot even distinguish the
passage where the emotion lies hid. It was a word, a look, a
silence, a gesture, a purely atmospheric combination, that held
him spellbound. So comes in the genius of the playwright's
trade, if those two words can be associated. One may compare
writing for the stage in relation to other phases of literature, as
we compare ceiling painters with [painters of] pictures for the
wall or the easel. Woe to the painter if he forget that his composition
is to be looked at from a distance, with a light below it!</p>

<p>A man without merit as a thinker, a moralist, a philosopher,
an author, may turn out to be a dramatic author of the first
class; that is to say, in the work of setting in motion before you
the purely external movements of mankind; and on the other
hand, to become in the theatre the thinker, the moralist, the
philosopher, or the author to whom one listens, one must indispensably
be furnished with the particular and natural qualities of
a man of much lower grade. In short, to be a master in the art
of writing for the stage, you must be a poor hand in the superior
art....</p>

<p>That dramatic author who shall know mankind like Balzac,
and who shall know the theatre like Scribe, will be the greatest
dramatic author that has ever existed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The following conversation in the first act of the play takes place
in the pleasant morning-room of a country-house near Paris, the home
of M. and Madame Leverdet. M. Leverdet is asleep in his chair. The
speakers are Madame Leverdet, a coquettish, sprightly lady approaching
middle age, and young M. De Ryons, a friend and neighbor. Madame
Leverdet is determined to marry off De Ryons advantageously, and as
soon as possible. Unfortunately he is a confirmed bachelor, not to say
woman-hater, whose cynicism is the result of severely disappointing
experiences. Under that cynicism there is however genuine respect and
even chivalry as to the right sort of woman,&mdash;the superior and sincere
type, which he does not happen often to encounter.]</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Leverdet</span>&mdash;Let us come to serious topics while we
are alone, my friend.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;And apropos of them?</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Are you willing to be married off yet?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i> [<i>with a start of terror</i>]&mdash;Pardon me, my dear lady!
At what hour can I take the first train for Paris?</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Now listen to me, at least.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;What! Here it is two years since I have called
on you; I come to make you a little visit of a morning, in all
good friendship, with the thermometer forty, centigrade; I am
totally unsuspecting; all I ask is to have a little lively chat with
a clever woman&mdash;and see how you receive me.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i> [<i>continuing</i>]&mdash;A simple, charming young
girl&mdash;</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i> [<i>interrupting her, and in the same tone</i>]&mdash; &mdash;musical,

woman, a domestic woman,&mdash;all at the choice of the applicant.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i> [<i>laughing</i>]&mdash;Yes, and pretty and graceful
and rich; and, by-the-by, one who finds you a charming fellow.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;She is quite right there. I shall make a charming
husband&mdash;I shall; I know it. Only thirty-two years old;
all my teeth, all my hair (no such very common detail, the way
young men are nowadays); lively, sixty thousand livres income
as a landed proprietor&mdash;oh, I am an excellent match: only unfortunately
I am not a marrying man.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;And why not, if you please?</p>

particular, my incessant study, and that I am reckoning on leaving
some new and very interesting documents dealing with that branch of
natural history?&mdash;a branch very little understood just at present, in
spite of all that has been written on the topic. My friend, I cannot
sacrifice the species to the individual; I belong to science. It is
quite impossible for me to give myself wholly and completely&mdash;as one
certainly should do when he marries&mdash;to one of those charming and
terrible little carnivora for whose sake men dishonor themselves, ruin
themselves, kill themselves; whose sole preoccupation, in the midst of
the universal carnage that they make, is to dress themselves now like
umbrellas and now like table bells.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i> [<i>scornfully</i>]&mdash;So you really think you understand
women, do you?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;I rather think I do. Why, just as you see me this
instant, at the end of five minutes' study or conversation I can
tell you to what class a woman belongs,&mdash;whether to the middle
class, to women of rank, artists, or whatever you please; what
are her tastes, her characteristics, her antecedents, the state of her
heart,&mdash;in a word, everything that concerns my special science.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Really! Will you have a glass of water?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;Not yet, thank you.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;I suppose, then, you are under the impression
that you know me too.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;As if I did not!</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Well, and I am&mdash;what?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;Oh, you are a clever woman. It is for that reason
that I call on you [<i>aside:</i> every two years].</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Will you kindly give me the sum of your
observations in general? You can tell me so much, since I am
a clever woman.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;The true, the true, the true sum?</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;Simply that woman of our day is an illogical, subordinate,
and mischief-making creature. [<i>In saying this De Ryons draws back and
crouches down as if expecting to be struck.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;So then, you detest women?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5013" id="Page_5013">[Pg 5013]</a></span>
<i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;I? I detest women? On the contrary, I adore them; but I
hold myself in such a position toward them that they cannot bite me. I
keep on the outside of the cage.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Meaning by that&mdash;what?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;Meaning by that, that I am a friend of the sex; for I have
long perceived that just as truly as women are dangerous in love, just
so much are they adorable in friendship, with men;&mdash;that is to say,
with no obligations, and therefore no treasons; no rights, and in
consequence no tyrannies. One assists, too, as a spectator, often as a
collaborator, in the comedy of love. A man under such conditions sees
before his nose the stage tricks, the machinery, the changes of
scenes, all that stage mounting so dazzling at a distance and so
simple when one is near by. As a friend of the sex and on a basis of
friendship, one estimates the causes, the contradictions, the
incoherences, of that phantasmagoric changeableness that belongs to
the heart of a woman. So you have something that is interesting and
instructive. Under such circumstances a man is the consoler, and gives
his advice; he wipes away tears; he brings quarrelsome lovers
together; he asks for the letters that must be returned; he hands back
the photographs (for you know that in love affairs photographs are
taken only in order to be returned, and it is nearly always the same
photograph that serves as many times as may be necessary. I know one
photograph that I have had handed back by three different men, and it
ended its usefulness by being given for good and all to a fourth one,
who was&mdash;not single).... In short, you see, my dear madam, I am above
all the friend of those women&mdash;who have known what it is to be in
love. And moreover inasmuch, just as Rochefoucauld says, as women do
not think a great deal of their first experience,&mdash;why, one fine day
or another&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;You prove to be the second one.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;No, no; I have no number, I! A well-brought-up woman never
goes from one experience of the heart to another one, without a decent
interval of time, more or less long. Two railroad accidents never come
together on the same railway. During the <i>intervals</i> a woman really
needs a friend, a good confidant; and it is then that I turn up. I let
her tell me all the melancholy affairs in question; I see the unhappy
victim in tears after the traitor has called; I lament with her, I
weep with her, I make her laugh with me: and little by little I
replace the delinquent without her seeing that I am doing so. But then I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5014" id="Page_5014">[Pg 5014]</a></span>
know very well that I am without importance, that I am a mere
politician of the moment, a cabinet minister without a portfolio, a
sentimental distraction without any consequences; and some fine day,
after having been the confidential friend as to past events, I become
the confidential friend as to future ones,&mdash;for the lady falls in love
for the second time with somebody who knows nothing of the first
experience, who will never know anything about it, and who of course
must be made to suppose he represents the first one. Then I go away
for a little time and leave them to themselves, and then I come back
like a new friend to the family. By-and-by, when the dear creature is
reckoning up the balance-sheet of her past, when her conscience pours
into her ear the names that she would rather not remember, and my name
comes with the others, she reflects an instant,&mdash;and then she says
resolutely and sincerely to herself, "Oh, <i>he</i> does not count!" My
friend, I am always the one that does not count, and I like it
extremely.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i> [<i>indignantly</i>]&mdash;You are simply a monster!</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;Oh no, oh no, oh no, I am not!</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;According to your own account, you have no faith in
women.... Wretch! Ungrateful creature! And yet it is woman who
inspires all the great things in this life.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;But somehow forbids us to accomplish them.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Go out from here, my dear De Ryons, and never let
me see you again.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i> [<i>rising promptly and making a mocking bow</i>]&mdash;My dear
lady&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;No, I will <i>not</i> shake hands with you.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;Then I shall die of chagrin&mdash;that's all about it.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Do you know how you will end, you incorrigible
creature? When you are fifty years old you will have rheumatism.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;Yes, or sciatica. But I shall find some one who will
embroider me warm slippers.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Indeed you will not! You will marry your cook.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;That depends on how well she cooks. Again farewell, dear
madam.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;No, stay one moment.</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;It is you who are keeping me; so look out.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Let me have really your last word on the whole
matter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5015" id="Page_5015">[Pg 5015]</a></span>
<i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;It is very easily given. There are just two kinds of
women: those who are good women, and those who are not.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Without fine distinctions?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;Without fine distinctions.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;What is one to do in the case of those who are
not&mdash;good women?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;They must be consoled.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;And those who are?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;They must be guaranteed against being anything else; and
as to that process of guarantee I have taken a patent.</p>

<p><i>Madame Leverdet</i>&mdash;Come now, if you are playing in parlor theatricals,
say so. What are you trying to be,&mdash;Lovelace or Don Quixote?</p>

<p><i>De Ryons</i>&mdash;I am neither the one nor the other. I am a man who, having
nothing else to do, took to studying women just as another man studies
beetles and minerals, only I am under the impression that my
scientific study is more interesting and more useful than that of the
other savant&mdash;because we meet your sex everywhere. We meet the mother,
the sister, the daughter, the wife, the woman who is in love; and it
is important to be well informed upon such an eternal associate in our
lives. Now I am a man of my time, exercised over one theory or
another, hardly knowing what he must believe, good or bad, but
inclined to believe in good when occasion presents itself. I respect
women who respect themselves.... It is not I who created the world; I
take it as I find it.... And as to marriage, the day when I shall find
a young girl with the four qualities of goodness of heart, sound
health, thorough self-respect, and cheerfulness,&mdash;the squaring of the
conjugal hypothenuse,&mdash;then I count for nothing all my long term of
waiting; like the great Doctor Faust, I become young again, and such
as I am, I give myself to her. My friend, if this same young girl of
whom you have been speaking (and by the way, I know her just as well
as you do) really unites these conditions,&mdash;I do not believe she does
so, though I shall see very soon,&mdash;why then, I will marry her
to-morrow&mdash;I will marry her to-night. But in the mean time, as I have
positively nothing to do,&mdash;if you happen to know a self-respecting
woman who needs to be kept from a bit of folly ... why, I am wholly at
your service.</p>

<h3><a name="MONEY" id="MONEY"></a>TWO VIEWS OF MONEY</h3>
<h4>From 'The Money Question'</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The following passage occurs in the first act of Dumas's play. The
characters include the young parvenu Jean Giraud, the aristocratic M.
De Cayolle, and several others, all guests in the drawing-room of the
country-house of Madame Durieu. In course of the conversation Giraud
refers to his father, at one time a gardener on the estate of M. De
Charzay.]</p></div>

<p><i>Jean Giraud</i>&mdash;Oh, yes, yes, I have got along in the world,
as people say. There are people who blush for their fathers;
I make a brag of mine&mdash;that's the difference.</p>

<p><i>Ren&eacute; de Charsay</i>&mdash;And what is Father Giraud nowadays?
Oh, I beg your pardon&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jean</i>&mdash;Don't be embarrassed&mdash;we keep on calling him Father
Giraud all the same. He is a gardener still, only he gardens on
his own account. He owns the house that your father was
obliged to sell a while ago. My father has never had but one
idea,&mdash;our Father Giraud,&mdash;and that is to be a land-owner; I
bought that piece of property for him, and so he is as happy as
a fish in the water. If you like, we will go and take breakfast
with him to-morrow morning. He will be delighted to see you.
How things change, eh? There, where a while ago we were the
servants, now we are the masters; though we are not so very
proud, for all that.</p>

<p><i>Countess Savelli</i> [<i>aside</i>]&mdash;He has passed the Rubicon of parvenus!
He has confessed his father! Now nothing can stop his way!</p>

<p><i>Jean</i> [<i>to De Charsay</i>]&mdash;I have wanted to see you for a
long time, but I have not been sure how you would meet me.</p>

<p><i>Ren&eacute;</i>&mdash;I would have met you with pleasure, as my uncle would have met
you. One cannot utter reproaches to a man who has made his own
fortune, except when he has made it by dishonest means; a man who owes
it to his intelligence and his probity, who uses it worthily,
everybody is ready to meet kindly, as you are met here.</p>

<p><i>Jean</i>&mdash;Sir, it is not necessary that a man should use his fortune
nobly, provided it is made&mdash;that is the main thing!</p>

<p><i>Madame Durieu</i>&mdash;Oh, oh, M. Giraud! there you spoil everything
that you have said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5017" id="Page_5017">[Pg 5017]</a></span>
<i>Jean</i>&mdash;I don't say that of my own case, madam, but I say just what I
say,&mdash;money is money, whatever may be the kind of hands where it
sticks. It is the sole power that one never disputes. You may dispute
virtue, beauty, courage, genius; but you can't dispute money. There is
not one civilized being, rising in the morning, who does not recognize
the sovereignty of money, without which he would have neither the roof
which shelters, him, nor the bed in which he sleeps, nor the bread
that he eats. Whither are bound these masses of people crowding in the
streets?&mdash;from the employ&eacute; sweating under his too heavy burden, to the
millionaire hurrying down to the Bourse behind his two trotters? The
one is running after fifteen sous, the other after one hundred
thousand francs. Why do we all have these shops, these railroads,
these factories, these theatres, these museums, these lawsuits between
brothers and sisters, between fathers and sons, these revelations,
these divisions in families, these murders? All for pieces, more or
less numerous, of that white or yellow metal which people call silver
or gold. And pray who will be the most thought of at the end of this
grand race after money? The man who brings back the most of it. Ah,
nowadays a man has no business to have more than one object in
life&mdash;and that is to become as rich as possible! For my part, that has
always been my idea; I have carried it out: I congratulate myself on
it. Once upon a time everybody found me homely, stupid, a bore; to-day
everybody finds me handsome, witty, amiable,&mdash;and the Lord knows if
<i>I</i> am witty, amiable, handsome! On the day when I might be stupid
enough to let myself be ruined, to become plain "Jean" as before,
there would not be enough stones in the Montmartre quarries to throw
at my head. But there, that day is a good way off, and meantime many
of my business acquaintances have been ruined for the sake of keeping
me from ruin. The last word, too, the greatest praise that I could
give to wealth, certainly is, that such a circle as I find myself in
at present has had the patience to listen so long to the son of a
gardener, who has no other right to their attention than the poor
little millions that he has made.</p>

<p><i>Durieu</i> [<i>aside</i>]&mdash;It is all absolutely true, every word that he has
been saying&mdash;gardener's son that he is! He sees our epoch just as it
really is.</p>

<p><i>Madame Durieu</i>&mdash;Come now, my dear M. De Cayolle, what
do you think of what M. Giraud has been telling us?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5018" id="Page_5018">[Pg 5018]</a></span>
<i>Cayolle</i>&mdash;I think, madam, that the theories of M. Giraud are sound,
but sound only as to that society in which M. Giraud has lived until
now: a world of speculation, whose one object naturally ought to be to
make money. As to wealth itself, it brings about infamous things, but
it also brings about great and noble things. In that respect it is
like human speech: a bad thing for some people, a good thing for
others, according to the use they make of it. This obligation of our
state of society that makes a man wake up each morning with taking
thought of the necessary sum for his personal wants, lest he take what
does not belong to him, has created the finest intelligence of all the
ages! It is simply to this need of money every day that we owe
Franklin, who began the world by being a printer's apprentice;
Shakespeare, who used to hold horses at the door of the theatre which
later he was going to immortalize; Machiavelli, who was secretary to
the Florentine republic at fifteen crowns a month; Raphael, the son of
a mere dauber; Jean Jacques Rousseau, a notary's clerk and an
engraver,&mdash;one who did not have a dinner every day; Fulton, once upon
a time a mechanic, who gave us steam: and so many others. Had these
same people been born with an income of half a million livres apiece,
there would have been a good many chances that not one of them would
ever have become what he did become. [<i>To M. Giraud.</i>] This race after
wealth, of which you speak, M. Giraud, has good in it: even if it
enriches some silly people or some rascals, if it procures for them
the consideration of those in a humble station of life,&mdash;of the lower
classes, of those who have cash relations with society, on the other
hand there is a great deal of good in the spur given to faculties
which would otherwise remain stationary; enough good to pardon some
errors in the distribution of wealth. Just in proportion as you enter
into the true world of society&mdash;a world which is almost unknown to
you, M. Giraud&mdash;you will find that a man who is received there is
received only in proportion to his personal value. Look around here
where we are, without taking the trouble to go any further, and you
will see that money has not the influence you ascribe to it. For
proof, here is Countess Savelli, with half a million francs income,
who in place of dining out with millionaires besieging her house
every day, comes quietly here to dine with our friends the Durieus,
people without title, poor people measured by her fortune; and
she comes here for the pleasure of meeting M. De Charzay,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5019" id="Page_5019">[Pg 5019]</a></span>
who has not more than a thousand crowns income, but who, for all the millionaires
in the world, would never do a thing a man ought not to do; and she meets
here M. De Roncourt, who has a business of fifteen hundred francs
because he gave up his fortune to creditors who were not his own
creditors. There is Mademoiselle De Roncourt, who sacrificed her dowry
to the same sentiment of honor; yonder is Mademoiselle Durieu, who
would never be willing to become the wife of any other than an honest
man, even if he had for his rivals all the Croesuses present and to
come; and last of all, one meets me here,&mdash;a man who has for money (in
the acceptation that you give the word) the most profound contempt.
Now, M. Giraud, if we listened to you for so long a time, it is
because we are well-bred people, and besides, you talk very well; but
there has been no flattery for your millions in our attention, and the
proof is that everybody has been listening to me a longer time than to
you,&mdash;listening to me, who have not like you a thousand-franc note to
put along with every one of my phrases!</p>

<p><i>Jean</i>&mdash;Who is that gentleman who has just been speaking?</p>

<p><i>Durieu</i>&mdash;That is M. De Cayolle.</p>

<p><i>Jean</i>&mdash;The railway director?</p>

<p><i>Durieu</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>Jean</i> [<i>going to M. De Cayolle</i>]&mdash;M. De Cayolle, I hope you
will believe that I am very glad to meet you.</p>

<p><i>Cayolle</i>&mdash;I dare say you are, monsieur. [<i>M. De Cayolle as he
utters the words turns his back upon Giraud and steps aside</i>.]</p>

<h3><a name="MARRIAGE" id="MARRIAGE"></a>M. DE R&Eacute;MONIN'S PHILOSOPHY OF MARRIAGE</h3>
<h4>From 'L'&Eacute;trang&egrave;re'</h4>

<p><i>Madame de Rumi&egrave;res</i>&mdash;See here, now, R&eacute;monin, you who claim to explain
everything as a learned man&mdash;can you solve this proposition? Why is it
that with all the quantity of love in this world, there are so many
unhappy marriages?</p>

<p><i>M. R&eacute;monin</i>&mdash;I could give you a perfect explanation, my
dear lady, if you were not a woman.</p>

<p><i>Madame de Rumi&egrave;res</i>&mdash;You mean that the explanation is not
decent?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5020" id="Page_5020">[Pg 5020]</a></span>
<i>M. R&eacute;monin</i>&mdash;No, I mean that it is a matter based on the
abstract.... It is this. The reason why marriages are
rarely happy, in spite of the "quantity of love" in question, is
because love and marriage, scientifically considered, have no relationship.
They belong to two sorts of things, completely differing.
Love is of the physical. Marriage is a matter of chemistry.</p>

<p><i>Madame de Rumi&egrave;res</i>&mdash;Explain yourself.</p>

<p><i>R&eacute;monin</i>&mdash;Certainly. Love is an element of the natural evolution of
our being; it comes to us of itself in course of our life, at one time
or another, independent of all our will, and even without a definite
object. The human creature can wish to be in love before really loving
any one!... But marriage is a social combination, an adjustment, that
refers itself to chemistry, as I have said; since chemistry concerns
itself with the action of one element on another and the phenomena
resulting: ... to the end of bringing about family life, morality, and
labor, and in consequence the welfare of man, as involved in all
three. Now, so often as you really can conform to the theory of such a
blending of things, so long as you happen to have effected in marriage
such a combination of the physical <i>and</i> chemical, all goes well; the
experiment is happy, it results well. But if you are ignorant or
maladroit enough to seek and to make a combination of two refractory
chemical forces in the matrimonial experiment, then in the place of a
fusion you will find you have only inert forces; and the two elements
remain there, together but unfused, eternally opposed to each other,
never able to be united!... Or else there is not merely inertia&mdash;there
are shocks, explosions, catastrophes, accidents, dramas....</p>

<p><i>Madame de Rumi&egrave;res</i>&mdash;Have you ever been in love?</p>

<p><i>M. R&eacute;monin</i>&mdash;I? My dear marquise, I am a scientist&mdash;I
have never had time! And you?</p>

<p><i>Madame de Rumi&egrave;res</i>&mdash;I have loved my children. M. de Rumi&egrave;res was a
charming man all his life; but he didn't expect me really to love him.
My son tells me his affairs of the heart; ... my daughter has already
made me a grandmother ... I have little to reproach myself as to my
past life, and now I look on at the lives of others, sometimes much
interested. I am like the subscribers to the Op&eacute;ra, who know the whole
repertory by heart, but who can always hear some passages with
pleasure and who encourage the d&eacute;butants.</p>

<h3><a name="FATHER" id="FATHER"></a>REFORMING A FATHER</h3>
<h4>From 'A Prodigal Father'</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The ensuing dialogue occurs in the first act of the play. The Count
de Ravonnieres and his son Andre reside together in their comfortable
bachelor's establishment in Paris, and are devotedly attached to one
another. The count, unfortunately, has only grown more careless of
money, more a gay man of the world, as he has grown older; and blessed
with a youthfulness of physique and temperament that nothing impairs,
he is as thriftless as he is fascinating. His son, accordingly, has
had to be the economist of their resources, which are at a dangerous
ebb. As the scene opens, the count is preparing to take luncheon, with
Joseph, the confidential servant of the house, in attendance.]</p></div>

<p><i>Joseph</i>&mdash;Monsieur is served.</p>

<p><i>Count de Ravonnieres</i>&mdash;Very well.  You will please go
to my florist Lemoine, the Opera florist,&mdash;you know who I
mean,&mdash;and tell him to send, to-day, with my card,&mdash;he has a
lot of cards of mine in advance,&mdash;to Mademoiselle Albertine de
la Borde, 26 or 28 Rue de la Paix&mdash;I don't exactly remember
the number that the lady gave me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Joseph</i>&mdash;No. 26.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Ah! You know her address, do you?</p>

<p><i>Joseph</i>&mdash;Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;To send her a bouquet of white lilacs and roses.
And I don't need you any more: go at once. [<i>Joseph bows, and
hands the Count a large envelope.</i>] What's all this?</p>

<p><i>Joseph</i>&mdash;Some law papers that have come in your absence, sir,
which I did not think ought to be forwarded to Dieppe.</p>

<p><i>Count</i> [<i>without taking the papers</i>]&mdash;Quite right. Has my son
seen them?</p>

<p><i>Joseph</i>&mdash;No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Very well; don't let him see them. Put them away
with the others.</p>

<p><i>Joseph</i>&mdash;May I beg monsieur to say a good word for me to
his son?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;As to what, Joseph?</p>

<p><i>Joseph</i>&mdash;Your son, sir, has just told me to look out for another
situation; and I am so attached to the family&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Oh, I will straighten all that out; if my son sends
you away I will take you into our service again. Come now,
get off to my florist; be quick about it.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Oh yes, it comes from London, and it is to pay for
the boat! That is no excuse for it. And what about the boat,
if you please?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;But my dear fellow, they had no business to present
it until the 15th.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Well?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Why, to-day <i>is</i> the 15th!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;You ought to know it.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;I thought that to-day was only the 14th! Have you
paid it?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Of course.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Ah! then I owe you six thousand francs. That's all
there is to the matter.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Yes, that's all! But you never said a word to me
about it; I had no money in the house: I had to send to our
man of business. May I beg of you in the future to be so good
as to&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Poor boy! poor boy! Really, between ourselves, you would have
done a great deal better (as it is a month since you have seen me, and
since you are really very fond of me) to embrace me in meeting me
again, rather than to say all these things to me that you have been
saying!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i> [<i>embracing his father heartily</i>]&mdash;Oh, of course they
make no difference, when it comes to <i>that</i>!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5023" id="Page_5023">[Pg 5023]</a></span>
<i>Count</i>&mdash;Your second impulse is a very good one; but you
ought to have begun with it. All the same, I do not in the less
ask pardon for the inconvenience that I have caused you, my boy.
[<i>Takes some bank-notes from his pocket.</i>] Here are your six thousand
francs, and [<i>holding out the remainder of the notes to Andr&eacute;</i>]
since you need money, help yourself.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Where in the world does that money come from?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Oh, it is some money that I have received.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;There was none coming to you from anywhere!</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;There is always something to come to one, if he looks
around carefully. And now let us speak of serious things.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Yes, by all means. Father, are you not disposed to
settle down?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;What do you mean by "settle down"?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;To save money, for one thing.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Save money! I should be charmed to do so; but I really do not
see how we can do it. We certainly live as modestly as possible. This
house belongs to us; we have only four saddle horses, four carriage
horses, a couple of extra horses for evening service (we could not get
along with less), two coachmen, two valets, two grooms, one cook. Why,
we haven't even a housekeeper.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;No, we only want that!</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;We never receive any except masculine society; we
certainly are not extravagant as to the table. Look at me here:
I am breakfasting this minute on two eggs and a glass of water.
It seems to me that with our fortune&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Our fortune? Would you like to know in what condition
our fortune is?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;You ought to know better than I, since it is you who
have had the running of affairs since your majority.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Well then, I <i>do</i> know the expenses; and let me tell
you that you have counted up only those that are part of our life
in Paris, and you have not said a syllable of those that belong
to our country one.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Those that belong to our country one! Those are all
just so much economy.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;So then the place at Vilsac is just so much economy?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Of course. We get everything from it, from eggs up
to oxen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5024" id="Page_5024">[Pg 5024]</a></span>
<i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Yes, and even to wild boars, when it suits you to
shoot one. Now be so good as to consider the place at Vilsac,
which you call a matter of economy. First of all, it brings us
in absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;It never has brought us in anything.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;It is mortgaged for two hundred thousand francs.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;That happened when I was young.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Are you under the impression that there comes a
time when mortgages wear themselves out? I wish they did.
But I am afraid that you deceive yourself; and in the mean
time, you are paying every year a mortgagor's interest. Furthermore,
at Vilsac&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Where, remember, we spend September, October,
November, all of which is positively an economy&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Furthermore, as to Vilsac, this summer place where
we pass September, October, and November,&mdash;all of which is
positively an economy,&mdash;the proof of its being an economy is
that here we are in the middle of September, and we are just
setting out for Dieppe.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;For one time only, by chance! And moreover, we
will have to go down to Vilsac by the end of the month, for I
have asked those fellows to come down there for the shooting.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Yes, in this economical country place, where you
have asked all those gentlemen to come down for the shooting,
at the end of the month&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Really, one would be bored to death without that!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;In this same economical establishment, I say, you
have twelve keepers.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Quite true; but it is one of the best preserves in
France, and really, there are so many poachers&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;You have two masters of hounds, you have ten horses,&mdash;in
short, a whole hunting equipage; and I don't speak of the
indemnities that you pay year by year, if only for the rabbits
that you kill.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;The fact is, there <i>are</i> thousands of rabbits; but shooting
rabbits is such fun!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Add to that the entertainments that it occurs to you
to give every now and then, with fireworks and so on, during
the evening.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Oh, yes, but that pleases all the peasants of the
neighborhood, who adore me; between ourselves it <i>is</i> rather&mdash;Oh,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5025" id="Page_5025">[Pg 5025]</a></span>
my dear boy! if I had only been rich, what fine things I
would have done! In France, people do not know how to spend
money. In Russia it is quite another matter! Now, there you
have people who understand how to give an entertainment. But
then what can anybody do with two hundred thousand livres for
an income?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Father, one can do exactly what you have done,&mdash;one
can ruin himself.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;What! ruin himself?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Yes. When my mother died your personal fortune
brought you, as you say, an income of two hundred thousand
livres; and the money which my mother left to me, of which you
have had the use until I came of age, amounted to a hundred
and twenty thousand livres.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;I certainly have made an accounting to you in the
matter.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;A perfectly exact one, only&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Only&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Only in doing so you have seriously impaired your
own capital.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Why did you not say that to me at the time?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Because I too&mdash;I was thinking of nothing but spending
money.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;You ought to have warned me about this before now.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;But I&mdash;I was doing then just what I see you doing;
I was taking life exactly as you had taught me to take it.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Andr&eacute;, I hope that is not a reproach.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;God bless me, no. I am only saying to you why I
have not looked after your interests better than you have ever
done so yourself.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Very good, Then I am going to explain to you why
I brought you up&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Not worth while, my dear father. There is no good
in going back to that, and I know quite well&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;On the contrary, you know nothing at all about the matter,
and you will please allow me to speak. It will be a consolation. You
are perfectly right as to things that have no common-sense in them;
and if I have brought you up after a certain manner, it is just because I
myself suffer from a different kind of education. <i>I</i> was brought up
very severely; at twenty-two years I knew nothing of life. I was born, I was kept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5026" id="Page_5026">[Pg 5026]</a></span>
hanging on at Vilsac, with my father and my mother, who were saints on
earth, with my great-uncle, who had the gout, and with my tutor, who
was an abb&eacute;. I was born with a constitution like iron. I went
hunting day by day for whole months, on foot or on horseback. I ate my
meals like an ogre. I rode every sort of a horse, and I was a
swordsman like St. George himself. As for other things, my dear
fellow, there was no use dreaming about them: I had not a crown in my
pocket. The other sex&mdash;well, I had heard it said that there was a
world of women somewhere, but I certainly did not know where it was.
One day my father asked me if I was willing to marry, and I cried out,
"Oh yes, yes!" with such an explosion that my father himself could not
help laughing&mdash;he who never laughed. I was presented to a young
girl, virtuous and beautiful; and I fell in love with her with a
passion which at first fairly frightened the delicate and timid
creature. Such was your mother, my dear Andr&eacute;, and to her I owe
the two happiest years of my life; it is true that I owe to her also
my greatest grief, for at the end of those two years she died. But it
must be said, either to the blame or to the praise of nature, that
organizations such as mine are proof against the severest shocks. At
twenty-four years I found myself rich, a widower, free to do what I
pleased, and thrown&mdash;with a child a year old&mdash;into the midst
of this world called Paris, of which I knew nothing whatever. Ought I
to have condemned you to this sort of life that I had led at Vilsac,
and which had been for me so often an intolerable bore? No, I obeyed
my real nature. I gave you my qualities and my shortcomings, without
reckoning closely in the matter; I have sought in your case your
affection rather than your obedience or your respect. I have never
taught you economy, it is true, but then I did not know anything about
that myself; and besides, I had not a business and a business name to
leave you. To have everything in common between us, one heart and one
purse, to be able to give each other everything and say everything to
each other,&mdash;that has been our motto. The puritans will think
that they have a right to blame this intimacy as too close: let them
say so if they choose. We have lost, it seems, some hundreds of
thousands of francs; but we have gained this,&mdash;that we can always
count upon each other, you upon me and I upon you. Either of us will
be ready at any moment to kill himself for the other, and that is the
most important matter between a father and a son;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5027" id="Page_5027">[Pg 5027]</a></span>
all the rest is not worth the trouble that one takes to reason about
it. Don't you think I am right?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;All that is true, my dear father! and I am just as
much attached to you as you are to me. Far be it from me to
reproach you; but now in my turn I want to make a confession
to you. You are an exception in our society; your fettered
youth, your precocious widowerhood, are your excuses, if you
need any. You were born at a time when all France was in a
fever, and when the individual, as well as the great mass of
people, seemed to be striving to spend by every possible means
a superabundance of vitality. Urged toward active life by nature,
by curiosity, by temperament, you have cared for things that
were worth caring for,&mdash;for them only; for entertaining yourself,
for hunting, for fine horses, for the artist world, for people of
rank and distinction. In such an environment as this you have
paid your tribute to your country, you have paid the debt of your
rank in life and of your name. But I, on the other hand, like
almost all my generation, brought in contact with a fashionable
world from the time that I began life,&mdash;I, born in an epoch of
lassitude and transition,&mdash;I led for a while this life by mere
imitation in laziness.... It is a kind of existence that no
longer amuses me; and moreover, I can tell you that it never
did amuse me. To sit up all night turning over cards; to get
up at two o'clock in the afternoon, to have horses put to the
carriage and go for the drive around the Lake, or to ride horseback;
to live by day with idlers and to pass my evenings with
such parasites as your friend M. De Tournas&mdash;all that seems to
me the height of foolishness. And at the bottom of your own
thoughts you think just as I do. So now, now that you really
have got to a serious explanation of affairs, let us reach a real
irrevocable determination of them. Are you willing to let me
arrange your life for you in the future exactly as I would wish
to arrange my own life? Are you willing to have confidence in
me, and after having brought me up in your way, are you willing
that in turn, while there is still time for it, I should&mdash;bring you
up in mine?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Yes, go on.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Very well,&mdash;to severe diseases strong remedies. You
think a great deal of our Vilsac estate?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;I was born there. I should not be sorry to end my
days there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5028" id="Page_5028">[Pg 5028]</a></span>
<i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Very well. We will keep Vilsac for you, and find
money in some other way to pay off the mortgage.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;How?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;That's my business; only you must send away the
two piqueurs, and six of the keepers.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Poor fellows!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;And only four horses are to be kept. No more entertainments
are to be given, no more fireworks. You will entertain only two or
three intimate friends now and then,&mdash;if we find as many friends as
that among all those that are about us nowadays here.&mdash;and you will
stay at Vilsac seven or eight months of the year.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Alone!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Wait a little. I have not finished yet. This house
where we are must be sold. We must put out of doors these
servants, who are just so many thieves; and we will keep at
Paris only a very modest stopping-place.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Will you kindly allow me to get my breath?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Don't stir, or my surgical operation will not be successful.
Now that your debts are paid there will be left to you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;There will be left to me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Forty thousand livres income, and as much for me,&mdash;no
more; and with all that, during three or four years you will
not have the capital at your disposition.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Heavens, what a smash!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Are you willing to accept my scheme?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;I must.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Very well, then: sign these papers!</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;What are they?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;They are papers which I have just got from the
notary, and which I have been expecting to make you sign while
at Dieppe and send to me; but since you are here&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i> [<i>signs</i>]&mdash;Since I am here, I may as well sign at once:
you are quite right,&mdash;there you are.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Very well; now as, according to my notions, just as
much as you are left to yourself you will slip back into the same
errors as in the past&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;What are you going to do further?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Guess.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;You are going to forbid&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5029" id="Page_5029">[Pg 5029]</a></span>
<i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Are you out of your senses? I am going to marry
you off.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Marry me off!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Without permission.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;And how about yourself?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;I am going to marry myself off&mdash;afterwards. You
must begin as an example.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Andr&eacute;, do you know something?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;What?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Some one has told you the very thing I have had in
mind.</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Nobody has told me anything.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Your word on it?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;My word on it.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Explain yourself. You, all by yourself, have had this
idea of marriage?</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;I myself.</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;Deny now the sympathy between us!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;Well?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;It exists [<i>putting his arms around his son</i>]. There,
embrace me!</p>

<p><i>Andr&eacute;</i>&mdash;And you accept?</p>

<p><i>Count</i>&mdash;As if I would do anything else!</p>

<h3><a name="CLARKSON" id="CLARKSON"></a>MR. AND MRS. CLARKSON</h3>
<h4>From 'L'&Eacute;trang&egrave;re'</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[These scenes, the final ones of the drama, occur in the private
drawing-room of Catherine, the young Duchess of Septmonts. Mr.
Clarkson, a wealthy American man of business, a Californian, has just
received a note from the Duke of Septmonts, a blas&eacute; young rou&eacute; of high
family, requesting him to call at once. He has come, in some
bewilderment, to find the duke. Mr. Clarkson has only a formal
acquaintance with the duke, but Mrs. Clarkson, who resides much of the
time in Paris, acting as Mr. Clarkson's business representative, knows
the duke confidentially. The Duchess of Septmonts receives Clarkson.]</p></div>

<p><i>Mr. Clarkson</i>&mdash;I beg your pardon, madam, for having insisted on
making my way in here; but a few moments ago I found on returning to my house,
a letter from your husband. It asked me for a rendezvous as soon as possible,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5030" id="Page_5030">[Pg 5030]</a></span>
without giving me a reason for it. I find M. de Septmonts not at home.
May I ask you if you know how I can be of service to him?</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;I was under the impression that in his letter, M.
de Septmonts explained to you the matter in which he wishes
your assistance.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Did not his letter contain another letter, sealed,
which he purposed leaving in your hands?</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Are you really telling me the truth?</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;I never lie, madam: I have too much business on
my hands; it would mix me up quite too much in my affairs.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Then perhaps it is to Mrs. Clarkson that my husband
has intrusted that letter.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;No. She would have mentioned it; for I told her
that I had received a line from the Duke, and was on my way
to this house.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Perhaps your wife did not tell you&mdash;all.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;She has no earthly reason to conceal anything from
me!</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;True! I know very well that she is your wife
only in name; she told me as much when I was at her house
yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Really! She must be very much pleased with you,
for she does not talk readily about her personal affairs.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Unfortunately, it is quite otherwise as far as I am
concerned; she has not hidden from me the fact that she detests
me, and that she will do me all the injury she possibly can.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;You? Injury? For what reason? Pray, what have
you done to her?</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Nothing! I have known her only two days.
Nevertheless&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Nevertheless&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;What I was going to say is not my secret, sir, it
is hers, and she alone has the right to tell it to you. But as to
this letter that my husband has told my father he has sent to you&mdash;it
is I who wrote that letter. You may as well know, too, that
it was abstracted from my possession; and moreover, that with
that letter any one can indeed do me all the mischief with which
your wife, Mrs. Clarkson, has threatened me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5031" id="Page_5031">[Pg 5031]</a></span>
<i>Clarkson</i> [<i>very gravely</i>]&mdash;Then we must know at once if my wife has
that letter. I will write her to come here immediately and join
us&mdash;that I have something very important to communicate to her&mdash;here.
Are you willing to have her come? [<i>He writes while he speaks.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Then we can have a general explanation. You may be sure,
madam, that I shall never lend my hand to anything that means harm to
you, or to any woman: I come from the country where we respect women.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i> [<i>rings the bell, and says to a servant who answers
it</i>]&mdash;See that this letter is sent immediately. Be careful that it
does not go astray. It is not my letter. This gentleman has
written it. [<i>Exit servant.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;And now, madam, do you know why M. de Septmonts
wishes to have an interview with me?</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Yes, I can guess. It concerns me, perhaps; but I
have no right to discuss the matter. It is something which belongs
to the Duke, and he alone has the right to impart it to
you. All I can do is to beg of you to have all details thoroughly
explained to you, and to look into them very carefully.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A</i> Servant <i>enters</i></p></div>

<p><i>Servant</i>&mdash;M. le Duc has come in; he will be glad to have
Mr. Clarkson come to him.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Very good. [<i>Going</i>.] I bid you good evening,
madam.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i> [<i>to the servant</i>]&mdash;Wait a moment. [<i>Going to Clarkson
and speaking in a low voice.</i>] Suppose I were to ask you a
very great service.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Ask it, madam.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Suppose I were to ask you to say to my husband
that you are waiting for him here in this drawing-room&mdash;that
you will be glad to speak with him <i>here</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Nothing but that? With great pleasure. [<i>To the
servant.</i>] Say to M. de Septmonts that I shall be obliged if he
will join me&mdash;here. [<i>Servant goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;I shall leave you; for if I know what is going to
be discussed in this interview, I neither could nor should take
part in it; but whatever may come of it, I shall never forget
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5032" id="Page_5032">[Pg 5032]</a></span>
that you have done everything that you could do as a courtesy
to me,&mdash;and that you are a gentleman. [<i>Exit Catherine.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>alone</i>]&mdash;Charming! She is charming, that little
woman; but may I be hanged if I understand one word of what
is going on here.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Duke of Septmonts <i>comes in hastily, and advances to</i>
Clarkson.</p></div>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;I have just come from your house, Mr. Clarkson. Mrs.
Clarkson told me you were here. I returned at once. Pardon me for
troubling you. If when I came in I asked you to come to my own
drawing-room, and have thus troubled you once more, it is because I
was told you were expecting me here, with the duchess. This is her
private parlor; and as what we have to say is a matter for men&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Therefore the duchess went to her own room
when your return here was announced.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Mr. Clarkson, did <i>she</i> tell the servant that you
would prefer to hold our conversation here?</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;No, I told him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Septmonts goes to the door of the room by which Catherine went out,
and closes the porti&egrave;re.</i>]</p></div>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>in a scornful aside</i>]&mdash;What an amount of mystery
and precaution!</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;The matter is this, Mr. Clarkson. I must fight a
duel to-morrow morning. This duel can terminate only in the
death of one or other of the contestants. I am the insulted one,
therefore I have the choice of weapons. I choose the sword.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Do you fence well?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;I believe I am one of the best fencers in Paris.
But another friend on whom I could count is one of those men
of the world who discuss all the details of an affair, and with
whom the preliminaries of such a meeting might last several
days. I want to get through with the matter at once.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Ah! The fact is, you <i>do</i> give an importance and
a solemnity to such things in France that we don't understand,
we Americans, who settle the question in five minutes on the
first corner of the street, in the sight of everybody.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;That is just the reason that I allowed myself to
apply to you, Mr. Clarkson. Now, are you disposed to be present
as my second?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5033" id="Page_5033">[Pg 5033]</a></span>
<i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Bless me, with all my heart! Besides, when I
mentioned your letter to Mrs. Clarkson she told me to do all
I could to serve you. Have you and my wife known each other
long?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;About four years; and I owe your wife a great
deal, morally speaking. I have no desire to conceal the fact. I
was not yet married when I met Mrs. Clarkson. One day I had
lost a large sum at play,&mdash;a hundred and fifty thousand francs,&mdash;which
I did not have, and tried in vain to procure; for at that
time I was completely ruined. Mrs. Clarkson very generously
lent me the sum, and I repaid it, with interest equivalent to the
capital.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;But as you were ruined, duke, how could you pay
this large capital and this large interest? Did your father or
mother die? In France the death of parents is a great resource,
I know.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;No. I was an orphan, and I had no expectations.
I married.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Ah, true! You French people make much of marriages for
money! It's a great advantage over us Americans, who only marry for
love. Now with us, in such a case as yours, a man goes into some
business or other; he goes to mining; he works. But every country has
its own customs. I beg your pardon for interrupting you. After all, it
doesn't concern me. Come back to our duel.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;I have a letter here in my hands&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Ah! You have a letter in your hands&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;A letter which compromises my wife&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Ah! I am completely at your service. I belong
to the sort of men who do not admit any compromises in matters
of that kind.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;I may be killed&mdash;one has to look ahead. If I
lose my life, I lose it by having been so injured by my wife that
I intend to be revenged on her.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;And how?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;I wish that the contents of this letter, which I
have in my possession, shall become public property if I am
killed.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>coldly</i>]&mdash;Ah! And how can I serve you as to that?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;I will intrust this sealed letter to you. [<i>He takes
the letter from his pocket.</i>] Here it is.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5034" id="Page_5034">[Pg 5034]</a></span>
<i>Clarkson</i> [<i>still more coldly</i>]&mdash;Very well.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Now, if I survive, you will restore it to me as it
is.  If not, then in the trial which will follow, you will read it
in a court.  I wish the letters to become public.  Then it will be
known that I avenged my honor under a feigned pretext; and M.
G&eacute;rard and the duchess will be so situated that they will never
be able to see each other again.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Nonsense! Once dead, what does it matter to you?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;I am firm there.  Will you kindly accept the commission?</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>in a formal tone</i>]&mdash;Surely.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Here is the letter.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>takes it and holds it as he speaks</i>]&mdash;But, duke,
now that I think about it, when this trial occurs it is probable,
even certain, that I shall not be in France.  I was expecting
to leave Paris on business to-morrow morning at the latest. I
can wait until to-morrow evening to please you, and to help
you with this duel of yours; but that is really all the time I can
spare.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Very well; then you will have the goodness to
give this letter to Mrs. Clarkson with the instructions I have just
given you, and it will be in equally good hands.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>looking at the letter</i>]&mdash;All right. A blank envelope.
What is there to indicate that this letter was addressed to M.
G&eacute;rard?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;The envelope with his name on it is inside.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;You found this letter?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;I found it&mdash;before it was mailed.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;And as you had your suspicions you&mdash;opened it?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;I beg your pardon for questioning you so, but you
yourself did me the honor to say that you wished me to be <i>fully</i>
informed.  Do you know whether the sentiments between M.
G&eacute;rard and the duchess were of long standing?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;They date from before my marriage.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>looking toward the apartment of the duchess</i>]&mdash;Oh,
I see.  That is serious!</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;They loved each other, they wanted to marry
each other, but my wife's father would not consent.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>reflectively</i>]&mdash;M. G&eacute;rard wanted to marry her, did he?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5035" id="Page_5035">[Pg 5035]</a></span>
<i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Yes; but when he learned that Mademoiselle
Mauriceau was a millionaire, as he had nothing and had no title
other than his plain name G&eacute;rard, he withdrew his pretensions.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;That was a very proper thing for the young man
to do. It doesn't surprise me!</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Yes; but now, Mr. Clarkson, this young gentleman
has come back&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;And is too intimate a friend to your wife?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Ah, I do not say that!</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;What do you say, then?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;That as the letter in question gives that impression,
the situation amounts to the same thing as far as a legal
process is concerned.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>thoughtfully and coldly</i>]&mdash;Oh-h-h!</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Don't you agree with me, Mr. Clarkson?</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;No, not at all. I can understand revenge on those who have
injured us, but not on those who haven't done so. And I don't like
vengeance on a woman anyway, even when she is guilty; and certainly
not when she is innocent; and you owe your wife a great deal&mdash;between
ourselves, you owe your wife a great deal, duke. I understand now why,
for once, your father-in-law M. Mauriceau sides with his daughter and
M. G&eacute;rard against you. He is sure they both are innocent. By-the-by,
does M. Mauriceau also know of this letter?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Yes. He even tried to take it from me by force.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Why did he not take it?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Ah, because you see, I had the presence of mind
to tell him that I did not have it any longer&mdash;that I had sent it
to you!</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>ironically</i>]&mdash;That <i>was</i> very clever!</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;And then when M. G&eacute;rard had challenged me, M.
Mauriceau thought he would make an impression by saying to
him before me, "I will be your second."</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Well, is that the whole story?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Very well, my dear sir: to speak frankly, all those
people whom you characterize so slightingly seem to me the right kind
of people&mdash;excellent people. Your little wife seems to be the
victim of prejudices, of morals, and of combinations about which we
mere American savages don't know anything at all. In our American
society, which of course I can't compare with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5036" id="Page_5036">[Pg 5036]</a></span>
yours, as we only date from yesterday,&mdash;if Mademoiselle Mauriceau
had loved a fine young fellow like M. G&eacute;rard, her father would
have given her to the man she loved; or if he had refused that, why
she would have gone quite simply and been married before the justice
of the peace! Perhaps her father wouldn't have portioned her; but then
the husband would have worked, gone into business, and the two young
people would have been happy all the same. As to your M. G&eacute;rard
here, he is an honest man and a clever one. We like people who work,
we Americans, and to whatever country they belong, we hold them as
compatriots&mdash;because we are such savages, I suppose. So you
understand that I don't at all share your opinion of this question.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;And so speaking, you mean&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;That if I give you this explanation, it is because I
think I understand that in paying me the honor of choosing me
as a second, you thought that the men of my country were less
clear-sighted, less scrupulous than the men of yours. In short,
duke, you thought I would lend my hand to all these social pettinesses,
these little vilenesses which you have just recounted with
a candor that honors you.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Do you happen to remember, Mr. Clarkson, that
you are talking to <i>me</i>&mdash;in this way?</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;To you. Because there are only two of us here!
But if you like, we will call in other people to listen.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Then, sir, you tell me to my face&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;I tell you to your face that to squander your
inheritance&mdash;to have gambled away money you did not have&mdash;to borrow it
from a woman without knowing when or how you could return it&mdash;to marry
in order to pay your debts and continue your dissipations&mdash;to revenge
yourself now on an innocent woman&mdash;to steal letters&mdash;to misapply your
skill in arms by killing a brave man&mdash;why, I tell you to your face
that all that is the work of a rascal, and that therefore a rascal you
are. Oh, what astonishes me is that fifty people haven't told you so
already, and that I have had to travel three thousand leagues to
inform you on the subject! For you don't seem to have ever suspected
it, and you don't look thoroughly convinced even now.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i> [<i>controlling himself with the greatest difficulty</i>]&mdash;Mr.
Clarkson, you know that I cannot call you to account until
I have settled with your friend M. G&eacute;rard. You take a strange
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5037" id="Page_5037">[Pg 5037]</a></span>
advantage of the fact, sir. But we shall meet again. Please return
me the paper you have had from me.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Your wife's letter? Never in the world! As it was
addressed to M. G&eacute;rard, it belongs to M. G&eacute;rard. I intend to
give it to M. G&eacute;rard. If <i>he</i> wants to return it to you, I won't
stand in the way; but I doubt whether he will return it.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;You will fight me, then, you mean?</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Oh! as for that; yes, fight as much as you like.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Very well; when I have finished with the other,
you and I will have our business together.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Say the day after to-morrow, then?</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;The day after to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Stop; I must start off by to-morrow night, at the
latest.</p>

<p><i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;You can wait. And while waiting, leave me!</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Duke, do I look like a man to whom to say "leave"
in that tone, and who goes? Now look at me; it isn't hard to
see what I have decided. I don't mean you to fight with G&eacute;rard
before you have fought with me. If G&eacute;rard kills you, I shan't
have the pleasure of crossing swords with "one of the first
fencers in Paris," which it will amuse me to do. If you kill
him, you cause irreparable misfortunes. If you think I'm going
to let you kill a man who has saved me twenty-five per cent. in
the cost of washing gold, you are mistaken! Come, prove you
are brave, even when you aren't sure of being the stronger! Go
and get a good pair of swords from your room (since the sword
is your favorite weapon&mdash;mine, too, for the matter of that), and
follow me to those great bare grounds back of your house. On
my way here I was wondering why in goodness's name they were
not utilized. In the heart of the city they must be worth a good
deal! We will prove it. As for seconds, umpires of the point
of honor, we'll have the people who pass by in the street&mdash;if
any do pass.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Septmonts rushes in a fury toward the door, but when there stretches his
hand toward the bell. Clarkson throws himself between him and the
bell.</i>]</p></div>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Ah! no ringing, please! Don't play the Louis XV.
gentleman, and order your servants to cudgel a poor beggar! or
as sure as my name is Clarkson, I'll slap your face, sir, before
all your lackeys!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5038" id="Page_5038">[Pg 5038]</a></span>
<i>Septmonts</i>&mdash;Very well, so be it! I <i>will</i> begin with you.
[<i>Angrily hastens from the room for the weapons.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Quite right! [<i>Looking coolly at his watch.</i>] Let me
see; why, perhaps I <i>can</i> get away from Paris this evening after
all. [<i>He goes calmly out at the back toward the darkened garden.</i>]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The Duchess of Septmonts has pulled aside the porti&egrave;re and looks toward
the door by which her husband and Mr. Clarkson have gone out. She
is very much agitated, and can hardly walk. She rings the bell, and

<p><i>Catherine</i> [<i>tremulously, to the servant</i>]&mdash;Ask my father to
come here, immediately. [<i>The servant goes out. Catherine looks
toward the window and makes a movement to go to it.</i>] No, I
will not look out! I will not know anything! I do not know
anything; I have <i>heard</i> nothing; the minutes that that hand
marks upon the clock, no one knows what they say to me. One
of them will decide my life! Even if I had heard nothing,
things would take the turn that they have, and I should merely
be amazed in knowing of them. Instead of knowing nothing, I
have merely to remember nothing. But no, no,&mdash;I am trying in
vain to smother the voice of my own conscience! What I am
doing is wicked. From the moment that I have known anything
about this, I am an accomplice; and if one of these two men is
killed he has been killed with my consent. No, I cannot and
I will not. [<i>She runs toward the door. As she does so Mrs.
Clarkson enters hastily.</i>] You, you, madam!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Clarkson</i>&mdash;Were you not really expecting me to-day,
madam? My husband sends me a note to say that you&mdash;and
he&mdash;wish to speak to me immediately.</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Madam, since Mr. Clarkson has written you, there
has occurred a thing which neither your husband, nor I, nor you
yourself could foresee.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Clarkson</i>&mdash;What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;While my husband the duke has been explaining
to Mr. Clarkson the reasons of the duel,&mdash;which you, you, madam,
have provoked,&mdash;your husband, who did not find these reasons
either sufficient or honorable, has undertaken to defend us&mdash;G&eacute;rard,
yes, G&eacute;rard, and me,&mdash;and so very forcibly, that at this
instant&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Clarkson</i>&mdash;They are fighting?</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Yes, yes, only a few steps away from here!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5039" id="Page_5039">[Pg 5039]</a></span>
<i>Mrs. Clarkson</i>&mdash;Ah! That sounds like Clarkson! [<i>She takes
a step toward the door.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;Madam, that duel must not go on.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Clarkson</i>&mdash;Why not?</p>

<p><i>Catherine</i>&mdash;I will not permit these two men to lose their
lives on my account.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Clarkson</i>&mdash;You? What difference does it make to you?
They are not doing anything but what they chose to do. "Hands
off," as the officials at the gaming-tables say when the ball has
stopped rolling. You have wished to be free, haven't you? and
you are perfectly right; you never said so to anybody, but you
begged it all the same of One who can do anything. He has
heard your prayer, and he has made use of me to save you; of
me, who have been anxious to destroy you! That is justice; and
do you think that I object&mdash;I who am to be the loser? In the
game that I play with Destiny, every time I make up my mind
that God is against me, I bow my head and throw up the game.
I don't fear any one except God. He is on your side. Let us
talk no more about it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Just as she is speaking the last words, Clarkson comes in. He is very
grave.</i>]</p></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Clarkson</i>&mdash;See there. You are a widow.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i> [<i>to Mrs. Clarkson</i>]&mdash;My dear No&eacute;mi, will you be so
kind as to hand that paper to our friend the duchess. She will
perhaps feel some embarrassment in taking it directly from my
hand&mdash;and it is a thing that must be returned to her. Such was
the last wish of her husband; he really did not have time to tell
me as much, but I fancy that I guess it right.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Mrs. Clarkson calmly takes the letter and goes to Catherine.</i>]</p></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Clarkson</i>&mdash;I once said to your friend M. R&eacute;monin that
if I lost my game I would lose like one who plays fair. Madam,
it was through me that your marriage came to pass; and now it
is through me that your marriage&mdash;is dissolved. [<i>Turning to
Clarkson.</i>] And now, Clarkson, my dear, let us get out of this.
You are a good and a brave fellow. I will go anywhere with
you. I have had enough of Europe&mdash;things here are too small.
Do you know, I really believe I am going to find myself in love
with you! Come, let us go! I am positively smothering.</p>

<p><i>Clarkson</i>&mdash;Yes, let us go.</p>

<h2><a name="GEORGE_DU_MAURIER" id="GEORGE_DU_MAURIER"></a>GEORGE DU MAURIER</h2>

<h4>(1834-1896)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 90px;">
<img src="images/capg385.png" width="90" height="90" alt="G" title="G" />
</div><p class="dropcap">eorge Louis Palmella Busson du Maurier was born in Paris on March
6th, 1834, and his early life was passed there. His father was a
Frenchman, who had married an Englishwoman in Paris. The Du Mauriers
came of an old family in Brittany, Du Maurier's grandfather having
been a small <i>rentier</i>, who derived his living from glass-works.
During Du Maurier's childhood his parents removed to Belgium and
thence to London. At seventeen years of age he tried for a degree at
the Sorbonne in Paris, but was not successful; and he was put, much
against his will, to study chemistry under Dr. Williamson at
University College, London. Du Maurier's father, whose characteristics
are described in 'Peter Ibbetson,' was an amateur of science. It has
been hinted by the son that certain unlucky experiments, which were
the result of the elder Du Maurier's fancy for the natural sciences,
considerably impaired the family fortunes. The father had bent his
heart on the son's being a man of science, but the son's tastes were
all for art. He did therefore little good in his chemical studies.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 178px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">George du Maurier</span></span>
</div>

<p>Du Maurier's father died in 1856, and he
then devoted himself definitely to art. He worked at the British Museum,
and made considerable progress there. He next went to Paris,
and lived the life which he has described in 'Trilby.' In 1857 he attended
the Academy at Antwerp, and studied under De Kaiser and
Van Lerius. His severe studies at Antwerp had the result that his
sight was seriously impaired, and he lost the use of his left eye.
After two years of enforced idleness he went to London to seek his
fortune. An old acquaintance of his student life in Paris introduced
him to Charles Reade, who in turn introduced him to Mark Lemon,
the editor of Punch. Through these acquaintances he obtained employment
in drawing for Once a Week, Punch, and the Cornhill Magazine.
On the death of Leech in 1864 he was regularly attached to
the staff of Punch, and till the time of his death continued to work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5042" id="Page_5042">[Pg 5042]</a></span>
for that periodical with ever-increasing success. It is not too much
to say that for many years Punch was chiefly and mainly Du Maurier.
He early marked out for himself an entirely new path, which was not
in the direction of caricature or broad comedy; grace, sentiment, and
wit, rather than fun, were the characteristics of his work. He confined
himself almost entirely to society, so that his field was a narrower
one than that of some of his coadjutors. He had not, for
instance, the masculine breadth of Leech, who represented with great
strength and humor the chief characters of English life,&mdash;the parson,
the soldier, the merchant, the farmer, etc.</p>

<p>Du Maurier was almost entirely a carpet knight. He drew London
society, and a certain phase of London society. The particular
society which he represented is of very recent existence. Thirty
years ago there was but one society in London. This was simply the
ancient aristocratic society of England, which gathered in London in
the season. It is true that there was an artistic society in London
at that time, but it was quite apart and of little general recognition
or influence. But since then there has come up in London a society
made up chiefly of artists, professional people, and successful merchants
(having moreover its points of contact with the old society),
which is very strong and influential. It is this which Du Maurier
knew, and which he represented. Even here, however, the types he
has selected for description were very special. But they were presented
with so much grace and charm that the public never tired of
them. To his type of woman he was especially faithful: the tall
woman with long throat and well-defined chin, much resembling the
figures of Burne-Jones and Rossetti, only somewhat more mundane.
We have the same woman in the heroine of 'Trilby.'</p>

<p>Though Du Maurier, before beginning 'Peter Ibbetson,' had never
written a book, he had had considerable literary experience, for he
is said to have spent as much time upon the construction of the dialogues
which accompanied his pictures as upon the pictures themselves.
The story of 'Peter Ibbetson' he had often related to his
friends, who had urged him to write it down. This he finally did,&mdash;at
the special instance, it is said, of Henry James. It appeared in
Harper's Magazine in 1891. 'Trilby' was published in 1894 in Harper's
Magazine, and at once attained a great popular success. The
publishers estimate that about 250,000 copies of the book have been
sold. Du Maurier had sold the book outright for &pound;2,000, but when it
became apparent that the work was to be a success, the publishers
admitted the author to a royalty, paying at one time $40,000. They
also shared with him the large sums paid for the dramatization of
the work. For 'The Martian,' his last novel, he received &pound;10,000
outright. This also was published in Harper's Magazine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5043" id="Page_5043">[Pg 5043]</a></span>
It is perhaps too early to pass judgment upon the merits of these
works. They have, no doubt, grave faults. The story of 'Peter
Ibbetson' has been completed when it is but two-thirds told. The
remaining portion of the book is a dream. This is of course a dangerous
reversal of the usual method of the story-teller, which is to
make dreams seem like facts. The hypnotic part of 'Trilby' is said
by the professional authorities on the subject to be bad science. The
hypnotism in 'Trilby' was perhaps a journalist's idea, that subject
being much talked of at the time the book was written. Du Maurier,
it need hardly be said, was by training a journalist, although the
training had been of the pencil rather than of the pen. The literary
style of the novels is curious. It makes no pretensions to finish; the
grammar even is sometimes at fault. But on the other hand, it has
decided merits. It is particularly easy, flowing, and simple. These
are not the qualities we should have expected from the nature of Du
Maurier's literary training. The brief dialogues which he has for so
many years appended to his sketches in 'Punch' would have educated,
we should have thought, the qualities of brevity and point
rather than those of ease and fullness. Certain peculiarities of the
style cannot be defended, but the author produces his effects in spite
of such solecisms. This is true of the matter of his stories as well
as of the style. They are at many points inartistically constructed;
but the stuff is good, and the works therefore hold their own in spite
of these drawbacks. They certainly have one virtue, which is most
necessary to the success of any work of the imagination: they have
reality. We believe as we read, and continue to believe after we
have ceased reading, that the Major and Mimsey and Taffy and
Trilby are real persons. They are real to us because they have in
the first case been real to their creator. It is possible, however, that
the pictures which accompany the text may increase the strength of
the illusion.</p>

<p>No book, in recent years at any rate, has had so instantaneous and
prodigious a popular success as 'Trilby.' Popularity is always hard to
explain with any certainty. It seems to be a quality in the warp and
woof of the mind of the man that has it. One condition appears to be
that he shall be in sympathy with the minds of the mass of his
fellow-beings. There was such a sympathy in Du Maurier's case; and to
be more particular, his kindly and friendly enthusiasm was a quality
to commend him to men. He had a power of enjoying beauty in his
fellow-beings. Then he had had a long education in the qualities that
make popularity. He had long studied the art of pleasing. It is not
improbable that in these novels, which were intended for the American
public, he may have played upon certain of our national
susceptibilities. We in this country like to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5044" id="Page_5044">[Pg 5044]</a></span>
have our literature taken seriously by the European. It may be that Du Maurier
may have had an inkling of this, for it is curious to note how much of our
poetry appears in these novels. Du Maurier had a very nice taste in
poetry, a genuine enthusiasm for it which it is heartily to be wished
were shared by all college professors of English literature. Thus, he
could not have chosen better lines than those which Peter Ibbetson was
in the habit of reciting to Mimsey, 'The Water-fowl' of
Bryant,&mdash;perhaps the most perfect poem ever produced in this
country,&mdash;a poem so "beautifully carried," as Matthew Arnold once
described it to the present writer. Poe's beautiful and musical lines,
written by him at fourteen,&mdash;'Helen, thy beauty is to me,'&mdash;are also
made use of. We have a good deal of Longfellow and other American
writers. 'Ben Bolt' is of course an American song. These appeals to
our national predilections may have influenced us. But the interest
and curiosity of our practical and hard-working American public in the
Bohemian art life of the Latin Quarter was also, no doubt, a chief
cause of the popularity of 'Trilby.'</p>

<p>Du Maurier did not live long to enjoy his success. He had always
been known to his friends as a sensitive man, this quality being
ascribed to ill health. Ill health was no doubt a chief cause of the
vexation with which he received certain comments upon his books,
in some cases inspired by envy of his success. Many of his recent
contributions to Punch have been at the expense of the unsuccessful
author, and have supported the thesis that ill success was not an
indubitable proof of genius. When Lord Wolseley asked him what
would be the title of his next novel, he said 'Soured by Success.'
He died in London on October 8th, 1896.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;well, I happen to forget what sort of a day this
particular day turned into, about six of the clock.</p>

<p>If it was decently fine, the most of them went off to dine at
the Restaurant de la Couronne, kept by the P&egrave;re Trin, in the
Rue de Monsieur, who gave you of his best to eat and drink for
twenty sols Parisis, or one franc in the coin of the empire.
Good distending soups, omelets that were only too savory, lentils,
red and white beans, meat so dressed and sauced and seasoned
that you didn't know whether it was beef or mutton, flesh, fowl,
or good red herring,&mdash;or even bad, for that matter,&mdash;nor very
greatly care.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5045" id="Page_5045">[Pg 5045]</a></span>
And just the same lettuce, radishes, and cheese of Gruy&egrave;re or
Brie as you got at the Trois Fr&egrave;res Proven&ccedil;aux (but not the
same butter!). And to wash it all down, generous wine in
wooden "brocs," that stained a lovely aesthetic blue everything it
was spilled over.</p>

<p>And you hobnobbed with models, male and female, students of law and
medicine, painters and sculptors, workmen and blanchisseuses and
grisettes, and found them very good company, and most improving to
your French, if your French was of the usual British kind, and even to
some of your manners, if these were very British indeed. And the
evening was innocently wound up with billiards, cards, or dominoes at
the Caf&eacute; du Luxembourg opposite; or at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Luxembourg, in
the Rue de Madame, to see funny farces with screamingly droll
Englishmen in them; or still better, at the Jardin Bullier (la
Closerie des Lilas), to see the students dance the cancan, or try and
dance it yourself, which is not so easy as it seems; or best of all,
at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de l'Od&eacute;on, to see Fechter and Madame Doche in the
'Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias.'</p>

<p>Or if it were not only fine, but a Saturday afternoon into the
bargain, the Laird would put on a necktie and a few other necessary
things, and the three friends would walk arm-in-arm to Taffy's hotel
in the Rue de Seine, and wait outside till he had made himself as
presentable as the Laird, which did not take very long. And then
(Little Billee was always presentable) they would, arm-in-arm, the
huge Taffy in the middle, descend the Rue de Seine and cross a bridge
to the Cit&eacute;, and have a look in at the Morgue. Then back again to the
quays on the Rive Gauche by the Pont Neuf, to wend their way westward;
now on one side to look at the print and picture shops and the
magasins of bric-&agrave;-brac, and haply sometimes buy thereof, now on the
other to finger and cheapen the second-hand books for sale on the
parapet, and even pick one or two utterly unwanted bargains, never to
be read or opened again.</p>

<p>When they reached the Pont des Arts they would cross it,
stopping in the middle to look up the river towards the old Cit&eacute;
and Notre Dame, eastward, and dream unutterable things and
try to utter them. Then turning westward, they would gaze at
the glowing sky and all it glowed upon&mdash;the corner of the Tuileries
and the Louvre, the many bridges, the Chamber of Deputies,
the golden river narrowing its perspective and broadening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5046" id="Page_5046">[Pg 5046]</a></span>
its bed, as it went flowing and winding on its way between
Passy and Grenelle to St. Cloud, to Rouen, to the Havre, to
England perhaps&mdash;where <i>they</i> didn't want to be just then; and
they would try and express themselves to the effect that life was
uncommonly well worth living in that particular city at that particular
time of the day and year and century, at that particular
epoch of their own mortal and uncertain lives.</p>

<p>Then, still arm-in-arm and chatting gayly, across the court-yard of
the Louvre, through gilded gates well guarded by reckless imperial
Zouaves, up the arcaded Rue de Rivoli as far as the Rue Castiglione,
where they would stare with greedy eyes at the window of the great
corner pastry-cook, and marvel at the beautiful assortment of bonbons,
pralines, drag&eacute;es, marrons glac&eacute;s&mdash;saccharine, crystalline substances
of all kinds and colors, as charming to look at as an illumination;
precious stones, delicately frosted sweets, pearls and diamonds so
arranged as to melt in the mouth; especially, at this particular time
of the year, the monstrous Easter eggs of enchanting hue, enshrined
like costly jewels in caskets of satin and gold; and the Laird, who
was well read in his English classics and liked to show it, would
opine that "they managed these things better in France."</p>

<p>Then across the street by a great gate into the All&eacute;e des
Feuillants, and up to the Place de la Concorde&mdash;to gaze, but
quite without base envy, at the smart people coming back from
the Bois de Boulogne. For even in Paris "carriage people" have
a way of looking bored, of taking their pleasure sadly, of having
nothing to say to each other, as though the vibration of so many
wheels all rolling home the same way every afternoon had hypnotized
them into silence, idiocy, and melancholia.</p>

<p>And our three musketeers of the brush would speculate on
the vanity of wealth and rank and fashion; on the satiety that
follows in the wake of self-indulgence and overtakes it; on the
weariness of the pleasures that become a toil&mdash;as if they knew
all about it, had found it all out for themselves, and nobody else
had ever found it out before!</p>

<p>Then they found out something else&mdash;namely, that the sting
of healthy appetite was becoming intolerable; so they would
betake themselves to an English eating-house in the Rue de la
Madeleine (on the left-hand side near the top), where they would
renovate their strength and their patriotism on British beef and
beer, and household bread, and bracing, biting, stinging yellow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5047" id="Page_5047">[Pg 5047]</a></span>
mustard, and horseradish, and noble apple-pie, and Cheshire
cheese; and get through as much of these in an hour or so as
they could for talking, talking, talking; such happy talk! as full
of sanguine hope and enthusiasm, of cocksure commendation or
condemnation of all painters, dead or alive, of modest but firm
belief in themselves and each other, as a Paris Easter egg is full
of sweets and pleasantness (for the young).</p>

<p>And then a stroll on the crowded, well-lighted boulevards,
and a bock at the caf&eacute; there, at a little three-legged marble table
right out on the genial asphalt pavement, still talking nineteen
to the dozen.</p>

<p>Then home by dark old silent streets and some deserted
bridge to their beloved Latin Quarter, the Morgue gleaming
cold and still and fatal in the pale lamplight, and Notre Dame
pricking up its watchful twin towers, which have looked down
for so many centuries on so many happy, sanguine, expansive
youths walking arm-in-arm by twos and threes, and forever talking,
talking, talking....</p>

<p>The Laird and Little Billee would see Taffy safe to the door
of his <i>h&ocirc;tel garni</i> in the Rue de Seine, where they would find
much to say to each other before they said good-night&mdash;so much
that Taffy and Little Billee would see the Laird safe to <i>his</i> door,
in the Place St. Anatole des Arts. And then a discussion would
arise between Taffy and the Laird on the immortality of the
soul, let us say, or the exact meaning of the word "gentleman,"
or the relative merits of Dickens and Thackeray, or some such
recondite and quite unhackneyed theme, and Taffy and the Laird
would escort Little Billee to <i>his</i> door, in the Place de l'Od&eacute;on,
and he would re-escort them both back again, and so on till any
hour you please.</p>

<p>Or again, if it rained, and Paris through the studio window
loomed lead-colored, with its shiny slate roofs under skies that
were ashen and sober, and the wild west wind made woeful music
among the chimney-pots, and little gray waves ran up the river
the wrong way, and the Morgue looked chill and dark and wet,
and almost uninviting (even to three healthy-minded young
Britons), they would resolve to dine and spend a happy evening
at home.</p>

<p>Little Billee, taking with him three francs (or even four),
would dive into back streets and buy a yard or so of crusty
new bread, well burned on the flat side, a fillet of beef, a litre
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5048" id="Page_5048">[Pg 5048]</a></span>
of wine, potatoes and onions, butter, a little cylindrical cheese
called "bondon de Neufch&acirc;tel," tender curly lettuce, with chervil,
parsley, spring onions, and other fine herbs, and a pod of
garlic, which would be rubbed on a crust of bread to flavor
things with.</p>

<p>Taffy would lay the cloth English-wise, and also make the
salad, for which, like everybody else I ever met, he had a special
receipt of his own (putting in the oil first and the vinegar after);
and indeed, his salads were quite as good as everybody else's.</p>

<p>The Laird, bending over the stove, would cook the onions
and beef into a savory Scotch mess so cunningly that you could
not taste the beef for the onions&mdash;nor always the onions for the
garlic!</p>

<p>And they would dine far better than at le P&egrave;re Trin's, far
better than at the English Restaurant in the Rue de la Madeleine&mdash;better
than anywhere else on earth!</p>

<p>And after dinner, what coffee, roasted and ground on the
spot, what pipes and cigarettes of "caporal," by the light of the
three shaded lamps, while the rain beat against the big north
window, and the wind went howling round the quaint old medieval
tower at the corner of the Rue Vieille des Mauvais Ladres
(the old street of the bad lepers), and the damp logs hissed and
crackled in the stove!</p>

<p>What jolly talk into the small hours! Thackeray and Dickens again, and
Tennyson and Byron (who was "not dead yet" in those days); and Titian
and Velasquez, and young Millais and Holman Hunt (just out); and
Monsieur Ingres and Monsieur Delacroix, and Balzac and Stendhal and
George Sand; and the good Dumas! and Edgar Allan Poe; and the glory
that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome....</p>

<p>Good, honest, innocent, artless prattle&mdash;not of the wisest,
perhaps, nor redolent of the very highest culture (which by the
way can mar as well as make), nor leading to any very practical
result; but quite pathetically sweet from the sincerity and fervor
of its convictions, a profound belief in their importance, and a
proud trust in their lifelong immutability.</p>

<p>Oh happy days and happy nights, sacred to art and friendship!
oh happy times of careless impecuniosity, and youth and
hope and health and strength and freedom&mdash;with all Paris for
a playground, and its dear old unregenerate Latin Quarter for a
workshop and a home!</p>

<h3><a name="CHRISTMAS" id="CHRISTMAS"></a>CHRISTMAS IN THE LATIN QUARTER</h3>
<h4>From 'Trilby.' Copyright, 1894, by Harper &amp; Brothers</h4>

<p>Christmas was drawing near.</p>

<p>There were days when the whole Quartier Latin would
veil its iniquities under fogs almost worthy of the Thames
Valley between London Bridge and Westminster, and out of the
studio window the prospect was a dreary blank. No Morgue! no
towers of Notre Dame! not even the chimney-pots over the way&mdash;not
even the little medi&aelig;val toy turret at the corner of the
Rue Vieille des Mauvais Ladres, Little Billee's delight!</p>

<p>The stove had to be crammed till its sides grew a dull deep
red, before one's fingers could hold a brush or squeeze a bladder;
one had to box or fence at nine in the morning, that one
might recover from the cold bath and get warm for the rest of
the day!</p>

<p>Taffy and the Laird grew pensive and dreamy, childlike and
bland; and when they talked, it was generally about Christmas
at home in merry England and the distant land of cakes, and
how good it was to be there at such a time&mdash;hunting, shooting,
curling, and endless carouse!</p>

<p>It was Ho! for the jolly West Riding, and Hey! for the bonnets
of Bonnie Dundee, till they grew quite homesick, and wanted
to start by the very next train.</p>

<p>They didn't do anything so foolish. They wrote over to friends in
London for the biggest turkey, the biggest plum-pudding, that could be
got for love or money, with mince-pies, and holly and mistletoe, and
sturdy, short, thick English sausages, half a Stilton cheese, and a
sirloin of beef&mdash;two sirloins, in case one should not be enough.</p>

<p>For they meant to have a Homeric feast in the studio on
Christmas Day&mdash;Taffy, the Laird, and Little Billee&mdash;and invite
all the delightful chums I have been trying to describe; and
that is just why I tried to describe them&mdash;Durien, Vincent, Antony,
Lorrimer, Carnegie, Petrolicoconose, l'Zouzou, and Dodor!</p>

<p>The cooking and waiting should be done by Trilby, her friend
Ang&egrave;le Boisse, M. et Mme. Vinard, and such little Vinards as
could be trusted with glass and crockery and mince-pies; and if
that was not enough, they would also cook themselves and wait
upon each other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5050" id="Page_5050">[Pg 5050]</a></span>
When dinner should be over, supper was to follow, with
scarcely any interval to speak of; and to partake of this, other
guests should be bidden&mdash;Svengali and Gecko, and perhaps one
or two more. No ladies!</p>

<p>For as the unsusceptible Laird expressed it, in the language
of a gillie he had once met at a servants' dance in a Highland
country-house, "Them wimmen spiles the ball!"</p>

<p>Elaborate cards of invitation were sent out, in the designing
and ornamentation of which the Laird and Taffy exhausted all
their fancy (Little Billee had no time).</p>

<p>Wines and spirits and English beers were procured at great
cost from M. E. Delevigne's, in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, and liqueurs
of every description&mdash;chartreuse, cura&ccedil;oa, ratafia de cassis, and
anisette; no expense was spared.</p>

<p>Also truffled galantines of turkey, tongues, hams, rillettes de
Tours, p&acirc;t&eacute;s de foie gras, "fromage d'Italie" (which has nothing
to do with cheese), saucissons d'Arles et de Lyon, with and without
garlic, cold jellies, peppery and salt&mdash;everything that French
charcutiers and their wives can make out of French pigs, or any
other animal whatever, beast, bird, or fowl (even cats and rats),
for the supper; and sweet jellies and cakes, and sweetmeats, and
confections of all kinds, from the famous pastry-cook at the corner
of the Rue Castiglione.</p>

<p>Mouths went watering all day long in joyful anticipation.
They water somewhat sadly now at the mere remembrance of
these delicious things&mdash;the mere immediate sight or scent of
which in these degenerate latter days would no longer avail
to promote any such delectable secretion. H&eacute;las! ahim&egrave;! ach
weh! ay de mi! eheu! [Greek: oimot]&mdash;in point of fact, <i>alas</i>!</p>

<p>That is the very exclamation I wanted.</p>

<p>Christmas eve came round. The pieces of resistance and
plum-pudding and mince-pies had not yet arrived from London&mdash;but
there was plenty of time.</p>

<p><i>Les trois Angliches</i> dined at le P&egrave;re Trin's, as usual, and
played billiards and dominoes at the Caf&eacute; du Luxembourg, and
possessed their souls in patience till it was time to go and hear
the midnight mass at the Madeleine, where Roucouly, the great
baritone of the Op&eacute;ra Comique, was retained to sing Adam's
famous No&euml;l.</p>

<p>The whole Quarter seemed alive with the r&eacute;veillon. It was
a clear frosty night, with a splendid moon just past the full, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5051" id="Page_5051">[Pg 5051]</a></span>
most exhilarating was the walk along the quays on the Rive
Gauche, over the Pont de la Concorde and across the Place
thereof, and up the thronged Rue de la Madeleine to the massive
Parthenaic place of worship that always has such a pagan, worldly
look of smug and prosperous modernity.</p>

<p>They struggled manfully, and found standing and kneeling room among
that fervent crowd, and heard the impressive service with mixed
feelings, as became true Britons of very advanced liberal and
religious opinions; not with the unmixed contempt of the proper
British Orthodox (who were there in full force, one may be sure).</p>

<p>But their susceptible hearts soon melted at the beautiful music, and
in mere sensuous <i>attendrissement</i> they were quickly in unison with
all the rest.</p>

<p>For as the clock struck twelve, out pealed the organ, and up rose the
finest voice in France:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Minuit, Chr&eacute;tiens! c'est l'heure solennelle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&ugrave; l'Homme-Dieu descendit parmi nous!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And a wave of religious emotion rolled over Little Billee and
submerged him; swept him off his little legs, swept him out of
his little self, drowned him in a great seething surge of love&mdash;love
of his kind, love of love, love of life, love of death, love of
all that is and ever was and ever will be&mdash;a very large order
indeed, even for Little Billee.</p>

<p>And it seemed to him that he stretched out his arms for love
to one figure especially beloved beyond all the rest&mdash;one figure
erect on high, with arms outstretched to him, in more than common
fellowship of need: not the sorrowful Figure crowned with
thorns, for it was in the likeness of a woman; but never that of
the Virgin Mother of our Lord.</p>

<p>It was Trilby, Trilby, Trilby! a poor fallen sinner and waif,
all but lost amid the scum of the most corrupt city on earth.
Trilby, weak and mortal like himself, and in woeful want of
pardon! and in her gray dove-like eyes he saw the shining of so
great a love that he was abashed; for well he knew that all
that love was his, and would be his forever, come what would
or could.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Peuple, debout! Chante ta d&eacute;livrance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No&euml;l! No&euml;l! Voici le R&eacute;dempteur!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5052" id="Page_5052">[Pg 5052]</a></span>
So sang and rang and pealed and echoed the big deep metallic
baritone bass&mdash;above the organ, above the incense, above
everything else in the world&mdash;till the very universe seemed to
shake with the rolling thunder of that great message of love and
forgiveness!</p>

<p>Thus at least felt Little Billee, whose way it was to magnify
and exaggerate all things under the subtle stimulus of sound,
and the singing human voice had especially strange power to
penetrate into his inmost depths&mdash;even the voice of man!</p>

<p>And what voice but the deepest and gravest and grandest
there is, can give worthy utterance to such a message as that,&mdash;the
epitome, the abstract, the very essence of all collective
humanity's wisdom at its best!</p>

<h3><a name="DREAMING" id="DREAMING"></a>"DREAMING TRUE"</h3>
<h4>From 'Peter Ibbetson.' Copyright 1891, by Harper &amp; Brothers</h4>

<p>As I sat down on a bench by the old willow (where the rat
lived), and gazed and gazed, it almost surprised me that
the very intensity of my desire did not of itself suffice to
call up the old familiar faces and forms, and conjure away these
modern intruders.  The power to do this seemed almost within
my reach: I willed and willed and willed with all my might, but
in vain; I could not cheat my sight or hearing for a moment.
There they remained, unconscious and undisturbed, those happy,
well-mannered, well-appointed little French people, and fed the
gold and silver fish; and there with an aching heart I left them.</p>

<p>Oh, surely, surely, I cried to myself, we ought to find some
means of possessing the past more fully and completely than we
do. Life is not worth living for many of us, if a want so desperate
and yet so natural can never be satisfied. Memory is but
a poor rudimentary thing that we had better be without, if it can
only lead us to the verge of consummation like this, and madden
us with a desire it cannot slake. The touch of a vanished hand,
the sound of a voice that is still, the tender grace of a day that
is dead, should be ours forever at our beck and call, by some
exquisite and quite conceivable illusion of the senses.</p>

<p>Alas! alas! I have hardly the hope of ever meeting my
beloved ones again in another life. Oh, to meet their too dimly
remembered forms in this, just as they once were, by some trick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5053" id="Page_5053">[Pg 5053]</a></span>
of my own brain! To see them with the eye, and hear them with
the ear, and tread with them the old obliterated ways as in a
waking dream! It would be well worth going mad, to become
such a self-conjurer as that.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I got back to my hotel in the Rue de la Michodi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>Prostrate with emotion and fatigue, the tarantella still
jingling in my ears, and that haunting, beloved face, with its
ineffable smile, still printed on the retina of my closed eyes, I
fell asleep.</p>

<p>And then I dreamed a dream, and the first phase of my real,
inner life began!</p>

<p>All the events of the day, distorted and exaggerated and jumbled
together after the usual manner of dreams, wove themselves into a
kind of nightmare and oppression. I was on my way to my old abode;
everything that I met or saw was grotesque and impossible, yet had now
the strange, vague charm of association and reminiscence, now the
distressing sense of change and desolation.</p>

<p>As I got near to the avenue gate, instead of the school on my
left there was a prison; and at the door a little thick-set jailer,
three feet high and much deformed, and a little deformed jaileress
no bigger than himself, were cunningly watching me out of
the corners of their eyes, and toothlessly smiling. Presently they
began to waltz together to an old familiar tune, with their enormous
keys dangling at their sides; and they looked so funny that
I laughed and applauded. But soon I perceived that their
crooked faces were not really funny; indeed, they were fatal and
terrible in the extreme, and I was soon conscious that these
deadly dwarfs were trying to waltz between me and the avenue
gate for which I was bound&mdash;to cut me off, that they might run
me into the prison, where it was their custom to hang people of
a Monday morning.</p>

<p>In an agony of terror I made a rush for the avenue gate, and
there stood the Duchess of Towers, with mild surprise in her eyes
and a kind smile&mdash;a heavenly vision of strength and reality.</p>

<p>"You are not dreaming true!" she said. "Don't be afraid&mdash;those
little people don't exist! Give me your hand and come in here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5054" id="Page_5054">[Pg 5054]</a></span>
And as I did so she waved the troglodytes away, and they vanished; and
I felt that this was no longer a dream, but something else&mdash;some
strange thing that had happened to me, some new life that I had woke
up to.</p>

<p>For at the touch of her hand my consciousness, my sense of
being I, myself, which hitherto in my dream (as in all previous
dreams up to then) had been only partial, intermittent, and
vague, suddenly blazed into full, consistent, practical activity&mdash;just
as it is in life, when one is well awake and much interested
in what is going on; only with perceptions far keener and more
alert.</p>

<p>I knew perfectly who I was and what I was, and remembered all the
events of the previous day. I was conscious that my real body,
undressed and in bed, now lay fast asleep in a small room on the
fourth floor of an <i>h&ocirc;tel garni</i> in the Rue de la Michodi&egrave;re. I knew
this perfectly; and yet here was my body too, just as substantial,
with all my clothes on; my boots rather dusty, my shirt collar damp
with the heat, for it was hot. With my disengaged hand I felt in my
trousers pocket; there were my London latch-key, my purse, my
penknife; my handkerchief in the breast pocket of my coat, and in its
tail pockets my gloves and pipe-case, and the little water-color box I
had bought that morning. I looked at my watch; it was going, and
marked eleven. I pinched myself, I coughed, I did all one usually does
under the pressure of some immense surprise, to assure myself that I
was awake; and I <i>was</i>, and yet here I stood, actually hand in hand
with a lady to whom I had never been introduced (and who seemed much
tickled at my confusion); and staring now at her, now at my old
school.</p>

<p>The prison had tumbled down like a house of cards, and lo!
in its place was M. Saindou's <i>maison d'&eacute;ducation</i>, just as it had
been of old. I even recognized on the yellow wall the stamp of
a hand in dry mud, made fifteen years ago by a day boy called
Parisot, who had fallen down in the gutter close by, and thus
left his mark on getting up again; and it had remained there for
months, till it had been whitewashed away in the holidays.
Here it was anew, after fifteen years.</p>

<p>The swallows were flying and twittering. A yellow omnibus
was drawn up to the gates of the school; the horses stamped and
neighed, and bit each other, as French horses always did in those
days. The driver swore at them perfunctorily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5055" id="Page_5055">[Pg 5055]</a></span>
A crowd was looking on&mdash;le P&egrave;re et la M&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois,
Madame Liard the grocer's wife, and other people, whom I
remembered at once with delight. Just in front of us a small
boy and girl were looking on, like the rest, and I recognized the
back and the cropped head and thin legs of Mimsey Seraskier.</p>

<p>A barrel organ was playing a pretty tune I knew quite well,
and had forgotten.</p>

<p>The school gates opened, and M. Saindou, proud and full of
self-importance (as he always was), and half a dozen boys whose
faces and names were quite familiar to me, in smart white trousers
and shining boots, and silken white bands round their left
arms, got into the omnibus, and were driven away in a glorified
manner&mdash;as it seemed&mdash;to heaven in a golden chariot. It was
beautiful to see and hear.</p>

<p>I was still holding the duchess's hand, and felt the warmth of it
through her glove; it stole up my arm like a magnetic current. I was
in Elysium; a heavenly sense had come over me that at last my
periphery had been victoriously invaded by a spirit other than mine&mdash;a
most powerful and beneficent spirit. There was a blessed fault in my
impenetrable armor of self, after all, and the genius of strength and
charity and loving-kindness had found it out.</p>

<p>"Now you're dreaming true," she said. "Where are those
boys going?"</p>

<p>"To church, to make their <i>premi&egrave;re communion</i>," I replied.</p>

<p>"That's right. You're dreaming true because I've got you
by the hand. Do you know that tune?"</p>

<p>I listened, and the words belonging to it came out of the
past, and I said them to her, and she laughed again, with her
eyes screwed up deliciously.</p>

<p>"Quite right&mdash;quite!" she exclaimed. "How odd that you
should know them! How well you pronounce French for an
Englishman! For you are Mr. Ibbetson, Lady Cray's architect?"</p>

<p>I assented, and she let go my hand.</p>

<p>The street was full of people&mdash;familiar forms and faces and
voices, chatting together and looking down the road after the
yellow omnibus; old attitudes, old tricks of gait and manner, old
forgotten French ways of speech&mdash;all as it was long ago.
Nobody noticed us, and we walked up the now deserted avenue.</p>

<p>The happiness, the enchantment of it all! Could it be that
I was dead, that I had died suddenly in my sleep, at the hotel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5056" id="Page_5056">[Pg 5056]</a></span>
in the Rue de la Michodi&egrave;re? Could it be that the Duchess of
Towers was dead too&mdash;had been killed by some accident on her
way from St. Cloud to Paris? and that, both having died, so near
each other, we had begun our eternal after-life in this heavenly
fashion?</p>

<p>That was too good to be true, I reflected; some instinct told
me that this was not death, but transcendent earthly life&mdash;and
also, alas! that it would not endure forever!</p>

<p>I was deeply conscious of every feature in her face, every
movement of her body, every detail of her dress,&mdash;more so than
I could have been in actual life,&mdash;and said to myself, "Whatever
this is, it is no dream." But I felt there was about me the
unspeakable elation which can come to us only in our waking
moments when we are at our very best; and then only feebly, in
comparison with this, and to many of us never. It never had to
me, since that morning when I had found the little wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>I was also conscious, however, that the avenue itself had a
slight touch of the dream in it. It was no longer quite right,
and was getting out of drawing and perspective, so to speak. I
had lost my stay&mdash;the touch of her hand.</p>

<p>"Are you still dreaming true, Mr. Ibbetson?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not quite," I replied.</p>

<p>"You must try by yourself a little&mdash;try hard. Look at this
house; what is written on the portico?"</p>

<p>I saw written in gold letters the words "T&ecirc;te Noire," and said so.</p>

<p>She rippled with laughter, and said, "No, try again;" and
just touched me with the tip of her finger for a moment.</p>

<p>I tried again, and said "Parvis Notre Dame."</p>

<p>"That's rather better," she said, and touched me again; and I
read, "Parva sed Apta," as I had so often read there before in
old days.</p>

<p>"And now look at that old house over there," pointing to my
old home; "how many windows are there in the top story?"</p>

<p>I said seven.</p>

<p>"No; there are five. Look again!" and there were five; and
the whole house was exactly, down to its minutest detail, as it
had been once upon a time. I could see Th&eacute;r&egrave;se through one of
the windows, making my bed.</p>

<p>"That's better," said the duchess; "you will soon do it&mdash;it's
very easy&mdash;<i>ce n'est que le premier pas</i>! My father taught me;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5057" id="Page_5057">[Pg 5057]</a></span>
you must always sleep on your back with your arms above your
head, your hands clasped under it and your feet crossed, the
right one over the left, unless you are left-handed; and you must
never for a moment cease thinking of where you want to be in
your dream till you are asleep and get there; and you must
never forget in your dream where and what you were when
awake. You must join the dream on to reality. Don't forget.
And now I will say good-by; but before I go, give me both
your hands, and look round everywhere as far as your eye can
see."</p>

<p>It was hard to look away from her; her face drew my eyes,
and through them all my heart; but I did as she told me, and
took in the whole familiar scene, even to the distant woods of
Ville d'Avray, a glimpse of which was visible through an opening
in the trees; even to the smoke of a train making its way to
Versailles, miles off; and the old telegraph, working its black
arms on the top of Mont Val&eacute;rien.</p>

<p>"Is it all right?" she asked. "That's well. Henceforward,
whenever you come here, you will be safe as far as your sight
can reach,&mdash;from this spot,&mdash;all through my introduction.
See what it is to have a friend at court! No more little dancing
jailers! And then you can gradually get farther by yourself.</p>

<p>"Out there, through that park, leads to the Bois de Boulogne&mdash;there's
a gap in the hedge you can get through; but mind and make everything
plain in front of you&mdash;<i>true</i>, before you go a step farther, or else
you'll have to wake and begin it all over again. You have only to will
it, and think yourself as awake, and it will come&mdash;on condition, of
course, that you have been there before. And mind, also, you must take
care how you touch things or people&mdash;you may hear, see, and smell; but
you mustn't touch, nor pick flowers or leaves, nor move things about.
It blurs the dream, like breathing on a window-pane. I don't know why,
but it does. You must remember that everything here is dead and gone
by. With you and me it is different; we're alive and real&mdash;that is,
<i>I</i> am; and there would seem to be no mistake about your being real
too, Mr. Ibbetson, by the grasp of your hands. But you're <i>not</i>; and
why you are here, and what business you have in this my particular
dream, I cannot understand; no living person has ever come into it
before. I can't make it out. I suppose it's because I saw your reality
this afternoon, looking out of the window at the T&ecirc;te Noire, and you are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5058" id="Page_5058">[Pg 5058]</a></span>
just a stray figment of my over-tired brain&mdash;a very agreeable
figment, I admit; but you don't exist here just now&mdash;you can't
possibly; you are somewhere else, Mr. Ibbetson; dancing at Mabille,
perhaps, or fast asleep somewhere, and dreaming of French churches and
palaces, and public fountains, like a good young British
architect&mdash;otherwise I shouldn't talk to you like this, you may be
sure!</p>

<p>"Never mind. I am very glad to dream that I have been of use to you,
and you are very welcome here, if it amuses you to come&mdash;especially as
you are only a false dream of mine, for what else <i>can</i> you be? And
now I must leave you: so good-by."</p>

<p>She disengaged her hands and laughed her angelic laugh, and then
turned towards the park. I watched her tall straight figure and
blowing skirts, and saw her follow some ladies and children into a
thicket that I remembered well, and she was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>I felt as if all warmth had gone out of my life; as if a joy had taken
flight; as if a precious something had withdrawn itself from my
possession, and the gap in my periphery had closed again.</p>

<p>Long I stood in thought, with my eyes fixed on the spot where she had
disappeared; and I felt inclined to follow, but then considered this
would not have been discreet. For although she was only a false dream
of mine, a mere recollection of the exciting and eventful day, a stray
figment of my over-tired and excited brain&mdash;a <i>more</i> than agreeable
figment (what else <i>could</i> she be!)&mdash;she was also a great lady, and
had treated me, a perfect stranger and a perfect nobody, with singular
courtesy and kindness; which I repaid, it is true, with a love so deep
and strong that my very life was hers to do what she liked with, and
always had been since I first saw her, and always would be as long as
there was breath in my body! But this did not constitute an
acquaintance without a proper introduction, even in France&mdash;even in a
dream. Even in dreams one must be polite, even to stray figments of
one's tired, sleeping brain.</p>

<p>And then what business had <i>she</i> in <i>this</i>, <i>my</i> particular dream&mdash;as
she herself had asked of me?</p>

<p>But <i>was</i> it a dream? I remembered my lodgings at Pentonville,
that I had left yesterday morning. I remembered what I was&mdash;why
I came to Paris; I remembered the very bedroom at the Paris hotel
where I was now fast asleep, its loudly ticking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5059" id="Page_5059">[Pg 5059]</a></span>
clock, and all the meagre furniture. And here was I, broad awake and
conscious in the middle of an old avenue that had long ceased to
exist&mdash;that had been built over by a huge brick edifice covered
with newly painted trellis-work. I saw it,&mdash;this
edifice,&mdash;myself, only twelve hours ago. And yet here was
everything as it had been when I was a child; and all through the
agency of this solid phantom of a lovely young English duchess, whose
warm gloved hands I had only this minute been holding in mine! The
scent of her gloves was still in my palm. I looked at my watch; it
marked twenty-three minutes to twelve. All this had happened in less
than three-quarters of an hour!</p>

<p>Pondering over all this in hopeless bewilderment, I turned my steps
towards my old home, and to my surprise, was just able to look over
the garden wall, which I had once thought about ten feet high.</p>

<p>Under the old apple-tree in full bloom sat my mother, darning small
socks; with her flaxen side-curls (as it was her fashion to wear them)
half concealing her face. My emotion and astonishment were immense. My
heart beat fast. I felt its pulse in my temples, and my breath was
short.</p>

<p>At a little green table that I remembered well sat a small boy, rather
quaintly dressed in a bygone fashion, with a frill round his wide
shirt collar, and his golden hair cut quite close at the top, and
rather long at the sides and back. It was Gogo Pasquier. He seemed a
very nice little boy. He had pen and ink and copy-book before him, and
a gilt-edged volume bound in red morocco. I knew it at a glance; it
was 'Elegant Extracts.' The dog M&eacute;dor lay asleep in the shade. The
bees were droning among the nasturtiums and convolvulus.</p>

<p>A little girl ran up the avenue from the porter's lodge and pushed the
garden gate, which rang the bell as it opened, and she went into the
garden, and I followed her; but she took no notice of me, nor did the
others. It was Mimsey Seraskier.</p>

<p>I went and sat at my mother's feet, and looked long in her face.</p>

<p>I must not speak to her nor touch her&mdash;not even touch her
busy hand with my lips, or I should "blur the dream."</p>

<p>I got up and looked over the boy Gogo's shoulder. He was
translating Gray's Elegy into French; he had not got very far,
and seemed to be stumped by the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"And leaves the world to darkness and to me."</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5060" id="Page_5060">[Pg 5060]</a></span>
Mimsey was silently looking over his other shoulder, her
thumb in her mouth, one arm on the back of his chair. She
seemed to be stumped also; it was an awkward line to translate.</p>

<p>I stooped and put my hand to M&eacute;dor's nose, and felt his
warm breath. He wagged his rudiment of a tail, and whimpered
in his sleep. Mimsey said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Regarde M&eacute;dor, comme il remue la queue! <i>C'est le Prince
Charmant qui lui chatouille le bout du nez.</i>"</p>

<p>Said my mother, who had not spoken hitherto:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do speak English, Mimsey, please."</p>

<p>O my God! My mother's voice, so forgotten, yet so familiar,
so unutterably dear! I rushed to her and threw myself on my
knees at her feet, and seized her hand and kissed it, crying,
"Mother, mother!"</p>

<p>A strange blur came over everything; the sense of reality
was lost. All became as a dream&mdash;a beautiful dream, but only
a dream; and I woke.</p>

<h3><a name="BARTY" id="BARTY"></a>BARTY JOSSELIN AT SCHOOL</h3>
<h4>From 'The Martian'</h4>
<h4>From Harper's Magazine. Copyright, 1896, by Harper &amp; Brothers</h4>


<p>Indeed, even from his early boyhood, he was the most extraordinarily
gifted creature I have ever known, or even heard of; a kind of
spontaneous humorous Crichton to whom all things came easily&mdash;and life
itself as an uncommonly good joke. During that summer term of 1847 I
did not see very much of him. He was in the class below mine, and took
up with Lafert&eacute; and little Bussy-Rabutin, who were first-rate boys,
and laughed at everything he said, and worshiped him. So did everybody
else, sooner or later; indeed, it soon became evident that he was a
most exceptional little person.</p>

<p>In the first place, his beauty was absolutely angelic, as will
be readily believed by all who have known him since. The
mere sight of him as a boy made people pity his father and
mother for being dead!</p>

<p>Then he had a charming gift of singing little French and English
ditties, comic or touching, with his delightful fresh young pipe,
and accompanying himself quite nicely on either piano or guitar
without really knowing a note of music. Then he could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5061" id="Page_5061">[Pg 5061]</a></span>
draw caricatures that we boys thought inimitable, much funnier than Cham's
or Bertall's or Gavarni's, and collected and treasured up. I have dozens of them
now&mdash;they make me laugh still, and bring back memories of which the
charm is indescribable; and their pathos to me!</p>

<p>And then how funny he was himself, without effort, and with
a fun that never failed! He was a born buffoon of the graceful
kind,&mdash;more whelp or kitten than monkey&mdash;ever playing the
fool, in and out of season, but somehow always apropos; and
French boys love a boy for that more than anything else; or
did in those days.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>His constitution, inherited from a long line of frugal seafaring
Norman ancestors (not to mention another long line of well-fed,
well-bred Yorkshire squires), was magnificent. His spirits
never failed. He could see the satellites of Jupiter with the
naked eye; this was often tested by M. Dumollard, ma&icirc;tre de
math&eacute;matiques (et de cosmographie), who had a telescope, which,
with a little good-will on the gazer's part, made Jupiter look as
big as the moon, and its moons like stars of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>His sense of hearing was also exceptionally keen. He could hear a
watch tick in the next room, and perceive very high sounds to which
ordinary human ears are deaf (this was found out later); and when we
played blindman's buff on a rainy day, he could, blindfolded, tell
every boy he caught hold of&mdash;not by feeling him all over like the rest
of us, but by the mere smell of his hair, or his hands, or his blouse!
No wonder he was so much more alive than the rest of us! According to
the amiable, modest, polite, delicately humorous, and ever tolerant
and considerate Professor Max Nordau, this perfection of the olfactory
sense proclaims poor Barty a degenerate! I only wish there were a few
more like him, and that I were a little more like him myself!</p>

<p>By the way, how proud young Germany must feel of its enlightened
Max, and how fond of him, to be sure! <i>Mes compliments!</i></p>

<p>But the most astounding thing of all (it seems incredible, but
all the world knows it by this time, and it will be accounted for
later on) is that at certain times and seasons Barty knew by an
infallible instinct <i>where the north was</i>, to a point. Most of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5062" id="Page_5062">[Pg 5062]</a></span>
readers will remember his extraordinary evidence as a witness in
the "Rangoon" trial, and how this power was tested in open
court, and how important were the issues involved, and how he
refused to give any explanation of a gift so extraordinary.</p>

<p>It was often tried at school by blindfolding him, and turning
him round and round till he was giddy, and asking him to point
out where the North Pole was, or the North Star, and seven or
eight times out of ten the answer was unerringly right. When
he failed, he knew beforehand that for the time being he had
lost the power, but could never say why. Little Doctor Larcher
could never get over his surprise at this strange phenomenon,
nor explain it; and often brought some scientific friend from
Paris to test it, who was equally nonplussed.</p>

<p>When cross-examined, Barty would merely say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Quelquefois je sais&mdash;quelquefois je ne sais pas&mdash;mais quand
je sais, je sais, et il n'y pas &agrave; s'y tromper!"</p>

<p>Indeed, on one occasion that I remember well a very strange
thing happened; he not only pointed out the north with absolute
accuracy, as he stood carefully blindfolded in the gymnastic
ground, after having been turned and twisted again and again&mdash;but
still blindfolded, he vaulted the wire fence and ran round
to the refectory door, which served as the home at rounders, all
of us following; and there he danced a surprising dance of his
own invention, that he called 'La Paladine,' the most humorously
graceful and grotesque exhibition I ever saw; and then,
taking a ball out of his pocket, he shouted, "&Agrave; l'amandier!" and
threw the ball. Straight and swift it flew, and hit the almond
tree, which was quite twenty yards off; and after this he ran
round the yard from base to base, as at "la balle au camp," till
he reached the camp again.</p>

<p>"If ever he goes blind," said the wondering M. M&eacute;rov&eacute;e,
"he'll never need a dog to lead him about."</p>

<p>"He must have some special friend above!" said Madame
Germain (M&eacute;rov&eacute;e's sister, who was looking on).</p>

<p><i>Prophetic words!</i> I have never forgotten them, nor the tear
that glistened in each of her kind eyes as she spoke. She was a
deeply religious and very emotional person, and loved Barty
almost as if he were a child of her own.</p>

<p>Such women have strange intuitions.</p>

<p>Barty was often asked to repeat this astonishing performance
before skeptical people&mdash;parents of boys, visitors, etc.&mdash;who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5063" id="Page_5063">[Pg 5063]</a></span>
been told of it, and who believed he could not have been properly
blindfolded; but he could never be induced to do so.</p>

<p>There was no mistake about the blindfolding&mdash;I helped in it
myself; and he afterwards told me the whole thing was "aussi
simple que bonjour" if once he felt the north&mdash;for then, with
his back to the refectory door, he knew exactly the position and
distance of every tree from where he was.</p>

<p>"It's all nonsense about my going blind and being able to do
without a dog," he added; "I should be just as helpless as any
other blind man, unless I was in a place I knew as well as my
own pocket&mdash;like this play-ground! Besides, <i>I</i> shan't go blind;
nothing will ever happen to <i>my</i> eyes&mdash;they're the strongest and
best in the whole school!"</p>

<p>He said this exultingly, dilating his nostrils and chest; and
looked proudly up and around, like Ajax defying the lightning.</p>

<p>"But what <i>do</i> you feel when you feel the north, Barty&mdash;a
kind of tingling?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I feel where it is&mdash;as if I'd got a mariner's compass trembling
inside my stomach&mdash;and as if I wasn't afraid of anybody or anything in
the world&mdash;as if I could go and have my head chopped off and not care
a fig."</p>

<p>"Ah, well&mdash;I can't make it out&mdash;I give it up," I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"So do I," exclaims Barty.</p>

<p>"But tell me, Barty," I whispered&mdash;"<i>have</i> you&mdash;have you
<i>really</i> got a&mdash;a&mdash;<i>special friend above</i>?"</p>

<p>"Ask no questions and you'll get no lies," said Barty, and
winked at me one eye after the other&mdash;and went about his business,
and I about mine.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">&nbsp;picturesque figure in a picturesque age is that of William Dunbar,
court minstrel to James IV., and as Sir Walter Scott declared, "a poet
unrivaled by any that Scotland has ever produced." Little of his
personal history is known. Probably he was a native of East Lothian, a
member of the family of the Earl of March, and a graduate of St.
Andrews University about the year 1479. After his college days he
joined the order of Franciscans and became a mendicant friar,
preaching the queer sermons of his time, and begging his way through
England and France. Yet in these pilgrimages the young scholar learned
useful habits of self-denial, saw new phases of human character, and
above all enjoyed that close communion with nature which is the need
of the poet. Over and over there is a reflection of this life in that
fanciful verse, which has caught the color of the morning hours when
the hedgerows are wet and the grass dewy, when the wild roses scent
the roadside and the lark is at matins&mdash;verse full of the joy of life
and the hope of youth.</p>

<p>After some years of this vagabond life, Dunbar left the Franciscans
and attached himself to the court, where he speedily became a
favorite. His day was one of pageant and show, of masque and
spectacle, and into its gay assemblage of knights and courtiers,
ladies and great nobles, Dunbar fitted perfectly. When an embassy was
sent to England to negotiate the royal marriage with Margaret Tudor,
Dunbar went along, being specially accredited by the king. He became a
favorite with the young Princess, and a poem written in honor of the
city of London, and one descriptive of the Queen's Progress, afford a
faithful and valuable memorial of this mission. History is fortunate
when she secures a poet as her scribe. Dunbar is principally known by
his three poems 'The Thistle and the Rose,' 'The Golden Targe,' and
'The Dance of the Seven Deadly Sins.'</p>

<p>The first of these is an allegory celebrating the nuptials of the
king. It suggests of course the allegories of Chaucer; but Dunbar's
muse is his own, and the poem springs fresh and clear from native
fonts. The poet represents himself as awakened by Aurora on a spring
morning and told to do homage to May. Through the symbolism of the
court of Nature, who crowns the Lion and Eagle, commissions the
Thistle and Rose as her handmaidens, and orders their praises sung by
the assembled birds of earth, the political significance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5065" id="Page_5065">[Pg 5065]</a></span>
of the allegory appears. But 'The Thistle and the Rose,' which is thus made
to illustrate the union between the two great houses of Scotland and
England, is far more than the poem of an occasion. It is full of the
melody and fragrance of spring, saturated with that sensuous delight
which at this bountiful season fills the veins of Nature. Here Dunbar
is no longer the court laureate, but the begging friar, wandering
through the green lanes and finding bed and board under the free
skies.</p>

<p>'The Golden Targe' is more artificial in construction. It is another
allegory, descriptive of an encounter between Cupid and Reason, who is
defended by a golden targe or shield from the attacks of love. Here
again the rural landscape forms a background to his mimic action.
Amazons dressed in green fight the battle of Cupid, and vanquish
Reason, then magically vanish and leave the poet to awake from his
dream. 'The Golden Targe' was a poem to be read in the royal presence,
when the court assembled after a day's hunting or an afternoon of
archery; but it is filled with the ethereal loveliness which only the
true poet beholds.</p>

<p>It is in 'The Dance of the Seven Deadly Sins' that Dunbar touches the
note of seriousness, which characterizes his race and his individual
genius. This satire is not so unsparing an indictment as the vision of
Piers Ploughman, and yet it provokes inevitable comparison with the
older poem. In a dream the poet sees heaven and hell opened. It is the
eve of Ash Wednesday, and the Devil has commanded a dance to be
performed by those spirits that had never received absolution. In
obedience to this command the Seven Deadly Sins present a masque
before his Satanic Majesty, and it is in the description of this
grisly performance that Dunbar reveals a new aspect of power. The
comedy here is not comic, but grotesque and horrid. The vision of the
Scot is the vision that came to the poets of the 'Inferno' and
'Paradise Lost,' and it shows that his imagination was capable of the
loftiest flights.</p>

<p>After the melancholy day of Flodden Field, the Scottish laureateship
ceased to exist, but it is remarkable that so prominent a man as
Dunbar should so completely have disappeared from contemporary view
that his subsequent career and the time of his death are matters of
doubt. His period is given as between the years 1465 and 1530, but
these dates are only approximate.</p>

<p>Had Dunbar held his genius in hand as completely as did Chaucer, his
accomplishment would doubtless have been greater than it was. Yet his
place in literature is that of one of the most important poets of the
fifteenth century, the age of Caxton and bookmaking, the time of that
first flush of radiance which ushered in the full day of Spenser and
Shakespeare.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">uruy, whose monumental works upon Grecian and Roman history have been
worthily reproduced in England under the editorship of Professor
Mahaffy, and in America in sumptuous illustrated editions, was a
figure of the first importance both in the educational and in the
distinctly literary history of France, throughout nearly half the
present century. He became one of the "Immortals" in 1884, succeeding
to the chair of Mignet; but his 'History of Ancient Greece,' which was
published in 1862, had been already crowned by the Academy. His more
extensive 'History of the Grecian People,' published in 1885-1887, won
from the Academy the Jean Renaud prize of 10,000 francs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 178px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Jean Victor Duruy</span></span>
</div>

<p>He was born September 11th, 1811, of a family employed in the Gobelins
tapestry works in Paris. His predilection for study secured him an
opportunity to enter the College of Sainte-Barbe, whence he passed to
the Normal School.</p>

<p>When he was twenty-two he began teaching history, first at Rheims, and
then in the College of Henry IV. in Paris. Here he began his literary
work, mostly upon school-books, of which he wrote many, mainly
historical and geographical. He received the degree of Doctor of
Letters in 1853, and became successively Inspector of the Academy of
Paris, Master of Conferences at the Normal School, Professor of
History at the Polytechnic School, and Inspector-General of Secondary
Instruction. During the whole of this period he had been engaged with
secondary classes, and had become strongly impressed by the faulty
condition of the primary and secondary schools. In 1863 Louis Napoleon
put him at the head of the educational system of the empire as Minister
of Public Instruction. This appointment gave him the opportunity to carry
out numerous and important secularizing reforms which brought him into
sharp collision with the clerical party. He held his post as minister
for six years&mdash;six years of struggle with the parsimonious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5070" id="Page_5070">[Pg 5070]</a></span>
disposition of the administration upon the one hand, and with the hostile
clericals upon the other.</p>

<p>The measures in which he was especially interested were the
reorganization of the Museum of Natural History, the extension of
scientific study, the introduction of the study of modern and
contemporary history in the lyceums (a dreadful experiment, according
to his opponents), gratuitous and compulsory primary education, the
improvement of the night schools, and popular classes for adults. He
was to a large extent successful in all these, except in the direction
of compulsory education. The efforts which he made to improve the
instruction given to young girls brought upon him the tempest. The
bishops, with Monsignor Dupanloup of Orl&eacute;ans at their head, raised a
veritable crusade, and Pope Pio Nono himself at length entered the
hostile ranks. Probably in part because of this conflict, he was
superseded in 1869 and was made a member of the Senate, from which he
retired to private life, and the prosecution of his literary labors on
the fall of the empire, in the following year. He died in 1894.</p>

<p>As an author his style is clear and direct. Among his numerous works
the most important are the two great histories, for which, as for
other achievements, honors were heaped upon him. In these he laid
particular stress upon the <i>milieu</i>&mdash;the conditions of place, time,
and race. Consequently he has therein written the history of the Greek
and Roman peoples, and not merely the history of Greece and Rome,&mdash;and
has pictured them, so far as possible, as they looked and felt and
thought and acted. He exhibits, for example, the growth of the
magnificent power of Rome, and its decadence; and shows the
all-conquering empire subdued to the manners, the gods, and the
institutions of the conquered. And worse:&mdash;"They had become enamored
of the arts, the letters, and the philosophy of Greece, and dying
Greece had avenged itself by transmitting to them the corruption which
had dishonored its old age."</p>

<p>The drift of his argument appears in this paragraph, in which he sums
up his story of the Eternal City:&mdash;"In the earlier portion of its
history may be seen the happy effects of a progressively liberal
policy; in the later the baneful consequences of absolute power,
governing a servile society through a venal administration."</p>

<h3><a name="POLICY" id="POLICY"></a>THE NATIONAL POLICY</h3>
<h4>From the 'History of Rome'</h4>

<p>The Roman power, till then confined to the West, was now to penetrate
into another universe,&mdash;that of the successors of Alexander. The
eternal glory of Rome, the immense benefaction by which she effaces
the memory of so many unjust wars, is to have reunited those two
worlds that in all former ages were divided in interest, and strangers
to each other; is to have mingled and fused the brilliant but corrupt
civilization of the East with the barbaric energy of the West. The
Mediterranean became a Roman lake,&mdash;<i>mare nostrum</i>, they said,&mdash;and
the same life circulated on all its shores, called for the first and
the last time to a common existence.</p>

<p>In this work were employed a century and a half of struggles and
diplomacy; for Rome, working for a patient aristocracy and not for a
man, was not compelled to attain her end at a bound. Instead of
rearing suddenly one of those colossal monarchies formed like the
statue of gold with feet of clay, she founded slowly an empire which
fell only under the weight of years and of the Northern hordes. After
Zama she could have attempted the conquest of Africa, but she left
Carthage and the Numidians to enfeeble each other. After Cynoscephal&aelig;
and Magnesia, Greece and Asia were all ready for the yoke, but she
accorded them fifty years more of liberty. This was because, along
with the pride of the Roman name and the necessity for dominion, she
always retained some of her ancient virtues. The Popiliuses were more
numerous than the Verreses. Now she preferred to rule the world; later
she will put it to pillage. Thus, wherever Rome saw strength she sent
her legions; all power was broken; the ties of States and leagues were
shattered; and when her soldiers were recalled they left behind them
only weakness and anarchy. But the task of the legions accomplished,
that of the Senate began. After force came craft and diplomacy. Those
senators, grown old amidst the terrors of the second Punic war, seemed
now to have less pleasure in arms than in the game of politics,&mdash;the
first, in all ages, of Italian arts.</p>

<p>Several other causes dictated this policy of reserve. Against the
Gauls, the Samnites, Pyrrhus, and Hannibal,&mdash;in other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5072" id="Page_5072">[Pg 5072]</a></span>
words, for the defense of Latium and of Italy,&mdash;Rome had employed all
her strength; it was then a question of her existence: whereas, in the
wars with Greece and with Asia, her ambition and her pride alone were
interested; and wisdom demanded that some relaxation be given to the
plebeians and the allies. The Senate had moreover too many affairs on
its hands&mdash;the wars with Spain, with Corsica, with Cisalpina, and with
Istria&mdash;to admit of its becoming deeply involved in the East.
Therefore two legions only will fight Philip and Antiochus&mdash;that
will suffice to conquer, but would be too little to despoil them.
Furthermore, the Senate believed that in penetrating into this Greek
world, where an old glory concealed so much weakness, they could not
accord too much to prudence. These pitiless enemies of the Volscians
and the Samnites will not proceed in their next wars by exterminating
their adversaries and wasting their country. "It was not with such a
purpose," said they, "that they came to pour out their blood; they
took in hand the cause of oppressed Greece." And that language and
that policy they will not change after victory. The first act of
Flamininus, on the day after Cynoscephal&aelig;, was to proclaim the liberty
of the Greeks. All who bore that respected name seemed to have the
right to Roman protection; and the little Greek cities of Caria, and
of the coasts of Asia and Thrace, received with astonishment their
liberty from a people that they hardly knew. All were captivated by
this apparent generosity. None perceived that in restoring
independence to the cities and States, Rome wished to break up the
confederations that sought to reorganize and would perhaps have given
new force to Greece. In isolating them and attaching them to herself
by grateful ties, she placed them almost insensibly under her
influence. She made allies of them; and every one knows what the
allies of Rome became. Thus the Senate was so well satisfied with
this policy, which created division everywhere and awakened extinct
rivalries, that for half a century it followed no other.</p>

<h3><a name="DOMINION" id="DOMINION"></a>RESULTS OF THE ROMAN DOMINION</h3>
<h4>From the 'History of Rome'</h4>

<p>Although in literature Rome was but the echo of Greece, she civilized
all the Western world, for which the Greeks had done nothing. Her
language, out of which sprang the various languages of the Romance
nations, is in case of need a means of communication among scholars of
all countries, and her books will always remain&mdash;a wise selection
being made&mdash;the best for the higher culture of the mind. They have
merited above all others the title of <i>litter&aelig; humaniores</i>, the
literature by which men are made. A cardinal, reading the 'Thoughts of
Marcus Aurelius' (written in Greek, it is true, but written by a
Roman), exclaimed, "My soul blushes redder than my scarlet at sight
of the virtues of this Gentile."</p>

<p>Suppose Rome destroyed by Pyrrhus or Hannibal, before Marius and C&aelig;sar
had driven the German tribes back from Gaul: their invasion would have
been effected five centuries sooner; and since they would have found
opposed to them only other barbarians, what a long night would have
settled down upon the world!</p>

<p>It is true that when the Roman people had laid hands upon the
treasures of Alexander's successors, the scandal of their orgies
exceeded for a century anything that the East had ever seen; that
their amusements were sanguinary games or licentious plays; that the
Roman mind, after receiving a temporary benefit from Greek philosophy,
went astray in Oriental mysticism; and that finally, after having
loved liberty, Rome accepted despotism, as if willing to astonish the
world as much by her great corruption as she did by the greatness of
her empire.</p>

<p>But can we say that no other age or nation has known servility of
soul, licentiousness in public amusements, and the conspicuous
depravity in morals that is always to be seen where indolence and
wealth are united?</p>

<p>To the legacies left by Rome which have now been enumerated, we must add
another, which ranks among the most precious. Notwithstanding the poetic
